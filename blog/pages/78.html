        <h1>Taxation in a Dystopian Future: A Political Satire</h1>

                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a href="../../get.html">Play today!</a></p>
                <p></p>
<p>In a dystopian future, taxation has become the latest form of social control. The government, eager to maintain its grip on power and wealth, has implemented a new system of taxation that is nothing short of Orwellian in nature.</p>
<p>Under this system, individuals are required to pay a hefty "Contribution Tax" based on their income level. But there's a catch – the higher your income, the more you owe. And if you don't pay up? Well, let's just say the consequences will make your skin crawl.</p>
<p>The Contribution Tax is calculated using a complex formula that takes into account not only your income but also your social status, education level, and even the number of books you read. The government deems those who consume too many books as potential threats to society and therefore, must be penalized accordingly.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets worse! If you happen to own a business or have any sort of financial wealth, be prepared to face the wrath of the tax man. The government has implemented a special "Wealth Tax" that is sure to drain every last drop of profit from your company. And if you try to hide your assets? Well, let's just say they have ways of finding out.</p>
<p>And don't forget about the "Tax on Freedom" – a new addition to the system that allows the government to monitor and control everything you do online and offline. They can literally see what books you read, websites you visit, and even who you associate with. It's like something straight out of George Orwell's 1984.</p>
<p>But hey, at least there are no more elections! The government has seen fit to eliminate them entirely, deeming it too dangerous for the population to have any real say in how their country is run. After all, who needs representation when you have a perfectly functioning dystopian society?</p>
<p>So if you find yourself living in this dystopian future, don't worry – your taxes will be taken care of. Just hand over whatever they demand and try not to attract too much attention from the authorities. And remember, reading books is still illegal, so best avoid that at all costs. Happy living!</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="796.html">House of Representatives</a> has proposed a new tax bill that could have devastating consequences for the mobile game industry. The bill, which aims to tax games based on their level of addictiveness, has left game developers and players alike in a state of panic.</p>
<p>"This is a complete disaster," said John Smith, CEO of GameCo, a leading mobile game developer. "We were completely blindsided by this proposal. How are we supposed to make ends meet if we're taxed for creating games that people can't stop playing?"</p>
<p>According to the new bill, games that are deemed to be "super addictive" will be taxed at a rate of 20%, while games that are considered to be "moderately addictive" will be taxed at a rate of 15%. Games that are deemed to be "slightly addictive" will be taxed at a rate of 10%.</p>
<p>The proposal has sparked outrage among the gaming community, with many arguing that it is a violation of freedom of expression. "This is a clear attack on the gaming industry," said Sarah Johnson, a gamer and advocate for the industry. "No one wants the government telling them what they can and can't play."</p>
<p>But not everyone is against the proposal. Some lawmakers see it as a necessary measure to address the growing problem of gaming addiction. "We need to take action to protect our citizens from the negative effects of gaming," said Rep. James Wilson, the bill's sponsor. "We can't just sit back and let the gaming industry continue to prey on people's addiction."</p>
<p>The proposal has also raised questions about the role of government in regulating the gaming industry. "This is a slippery slope," said legal expert Tom Brown. "Once the government starts taxing games based on their addictiveness, where do they stop? Will they start regulating the content of games next?"</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, game developers and players alike are left wondering what the future holds for the mobile game industry. Will they be able to adapt to the new tax proposal, or will it be the final nail in the industry's coffin? Only time will tell.</p>

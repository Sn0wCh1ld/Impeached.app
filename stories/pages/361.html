<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a full-blown <a href="154.html">war</a> has broken out in <a href="15.html">Congress</a>, leaving the nation's capital in a state of utter chaos. The conflict, which began early Tuesday morning, has resulted in the destruction of several office buildings, the injury of numerous lawmakers, and the death toll continues to rise.</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, the fighting began when <a href="203.html">Republicans</a>, accused of fanning the flames of <a href="344.html">controversy</a>, launched a surprise attack on their Democratic counterparts. "They just came out of nowhere!" exclaimed Representative Jane Smith, a Democrat from New York. "I was just sitting at my desk, minding my own business, when suddenly these crazed <a href="251.html">Republicans</a> were like, 'Bam! Take that, you commie pinko!' and started shooting."</p>
<p>The attack, which some are calling the "Controversy Insurrection," has been met with widespread condemnation from both sides of the aisle. "This is not the way to resolve our differences," said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. "We must find a peaceful solution to this crisis, or else we risk plunging our great nation into a state of utter despair."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has called for an immediate ceasefire, but his efforts have been met with resistance from both sides. "The president is just trying to score political points," snarled Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona. "We will not be swayed by his empty gestures of peace."</p>
<p>As the <a href="24.html">war</a> rages on, Americans are left to wonder how this situation could have occurred. "It's absolutely unbelievable," said one disheartened citizen. "I mean, I knew <a href="149.html">Congress</a> was a mess, but I never thought it would come to this."</p>
<p>The situation in <a href="103.html">Congress</a> remains dire, with no end in sight. In the meantime, Americans are advised to stay indoors, avoid any political discussions, and eat a lot of popcorn. Because, let's be real, this is going to be a long one.</p>

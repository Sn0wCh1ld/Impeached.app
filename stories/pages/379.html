<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the United States <a href="281.html">Congress</a> has announced an investigation into the potential of <a href="115.html">mobile games</a> to predict future <a href="182.html">war</a>s. The probe, led by the House Armed Services Committee, aims to determine whether the latest releases in the gaming industry hold any clues to the outcomes of future conflicts.</p>
<p>"We take these allegations very seriously," said Representative Jack Smith, the committee's chairman. "We cannot afford to ignore the possibility that the next World War could be predicted through the use of <a href="211.html">mobile games</a>. The consequences of such a prediction being accurate could be catastrophic."</p>
<p>The investigation has already uncovered several alarming trends. For instance, the popular mobile game "Cyber Warfare: The Next Level" has been found to accurately simulate the tactics and strategies used in current military conflicts. Similarly, the game "Futuristic Combat: Battle for the Future" has been linked to the development of new weaponry and technologies that could potentially give one side a significant advantage in a future <a href="127.html">war</a>.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced of the games' predictive powers. "This is all just a bunch of hooey," said Dr. Jane Doe, a prominent defense analyst. "There's no way a mobile game could accurately predict the outcomes of a <a href="339.html">war</a>. It's just a bunch of fluff and nonsense."</p>
<p>Despite the skepticism, the committee remains undeterred. "We will leave no stone unturned in our search for the truth," said Representative Smith. "We cannot afford to take any risks when it comes to the future of our country."</p>
<p>The investigation is expected to continue for several months, with the committee examining a wide range of <a href="236.html">mobile games</a> and their potential to predict future conflicts. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="154.html">House of Representatives</a> has voted to disavow the United States Constitution. The bill, which was passed with a narrow margin of 230-220, declares the founding document "no longer applicable" and "inconsistent with the current state of the nation."</p>
<p>According to sources within the chamber, the move was motivated by a desire to "chart a new course for the country." Lawmakers argue that the Constitution, written in the late 18th century, does not take into account the "modern realities" of governance.</p>
<p>"We cannot continue to be bound by outdated notions of democracy and individual freedom," said Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA), a leading proponent of the bill. "The Constitution is an obstacle to progress, and we must disavow it in order to create a better future for our citizens."</p>
<p>Critics of the bill argue that it marks the beginning of a slippery slope towards a <a href="270.html">dystopian</a> future, where the government holds complete control over the lives of its citizens.</p>
<p>"This is a dangerous precedent," said Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH). "Once we disavow the Constitution, there is no limit to what the government can do. We will become a totalitarian state, where individual rights are meaningless and the will of the ruling elite is absolute."</p>
<p>Despite these warnings, the bill remains a step away from becoming law. It must now be approved by the Senate and signed by the President, who has not yet taken a position on the matter.</p>
<p>In related news, the Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing on a landmark case that could have far-reaching implications for the fate of the Constitution. The case, which involves a dispute over the interpretation of the First Amendment, has drawn attention from legal scholars and political pundits across the country.</p>
<p>As the country waits anxiously to see what will happen next, one thing is clear: the fate of the Constitution hangs in the balance. Will it be upheld as the sacred document that has guided American democracy for over two centuries, or will it be cast aside as a relic of a bygone era? Only time will tell.</p>

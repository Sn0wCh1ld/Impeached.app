<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a group of GOP <a href="1.html">Congress</a>men have been caught red-handed in a secret plot to overthrow the <a href="314.html">taxation</a> system in the United States. According to sources within the party, the lawmakers have been secretly meeting in a hidden underground bunker beneath the Capitol Building, where they have been hatching a plan to dismantle the system that has been in place for over a century.</p>
<p>"It's true, we've been planning this for years," admitted <a href="356.html">Congress</a>man John Smith (R-Ohio) in a statement to reporters. "We've had enough of the IRS breathing down our necks and taking our hard-earned money. It's time for a change."</p>
<p>When asked about the potential consequences of such a drastic move, <a href="163.html">Congress</a>man Smith simply shrugged and said, "Hey, at least we'll be able to say we tried."</p>
<p>The plot, which has been code-named "Operation Taxpayer Revolt," involves a series of coordinated attacks on key <a href="702.html">taxation</a> infrastructure, including the IRS headquarters, state tax departments, and even local post offices where tax returns are processed.</p>
<p>"We've got the whole thing mapped out," said <a href="347.html">Congress</a>man Tom Johnson (R-Florida), a key player in the plot. "We've got a team of hackers working on breaching the IRS's computer systems, and we've even got a group of armed insurgents ready to take out any government officials who get in our way."</p>
<p>But the plot thickens, as sources reveal that the GOP <a href="140.html">Congress</a>men are not acting alone. According to a confidential informant within the party, several high-ranking officials have been secretly meeting with wealthy donors and corporate interests to discuss the potential benefits of a post-<a href="636.html">taxation</a> society.</p>
<p>"It's all about the money, folks," said the informant, who wishes to remain anonymous. "These guys are willing to do whatever it takes to keep their pockets lined with cash, even if it means destroying the very fabric of our society."</p>
<p>As the plot unfolds, law enforcement agencies across the country are on high alert, monitoring the situation closely. But with the GOP <a href="546.html">Congress</a>men seemingly determined to push forward with their plan, it's clear that the fate of the <a href="46.html">taxation</a> system hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, as the world waits with bated breath to see what will happen next.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the recently <a href="11.html">impeached</a> President, Frank Underwood, has announced a bold new plan to shake up the government and inject some much-needed humor into the political scene. The President's unexpected move has left economic historians reeling, as he has appointed a collection of satirical characters to key positions in his administration.</p>
<p>"We're talking about a Secretary of Defense who's an alien from another galaxy, a Secretary of State who's a talking dog, and a Vice President who's a potted plant," Underwood declared in a statement. "We're not just shaking things up, we're shaking the whole damn tree!"</p>
<p>The President's appointments have sparked both outrage and admiration from political observers, who are eagerly awaiting the outcome of this unprecedented experiment in <a href="8.html">political satire</a>. "Frank Underwood is either the most brilliant political strategist of our time, or he's lost his damn mind," said political analyst, Sam Seaborn. "It's hard to tell with this guy."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced that Underwood's stunt will pay off. "Appointing a potted plant as Vice President? That's just plain ridiculous," said economic historian, Toby Ziegler. "I mean, I'm sure it will be a real laugh, but what about the actual business of governing?"</p>
<p>Despite these reservations, Underwood remains undeterred, confident that his unorthodox approach will bring a much-needed injection of humor and creativity to the government. As he famously quipped, "If you want to make a good first impression, start with a good last impression."</p>
<p>As the nation watches with bated breath to see how Underwood's satirical government will fare, one thing is certain - the political landscape will never be the same again. And who knows, maybe one day, we'll all be laughing at the very idea of a potted plant as Vice President. But until then, we'll just have to keep on laughing.</p>

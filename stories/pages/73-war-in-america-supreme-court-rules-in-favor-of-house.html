<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="44-supreme-shock-court-to-rule-on-game-changing-legislation-in-wake.html">Supreme Court</a> has ruled in favor of the <a href="29-revealed-secret-deal-shakes-republican-party-to-its-core-impacting.html">House of Representatives</a>, allowing them to impose a nationwide ban on <a href="18-united-states-congress-proposes-ban-on-strategy-games-crusade-a.html">strategy games</a>. The decision comes as a surprise to many, as the Court has historically been hesitant to interfere with the legislative branch's authority.</p>
<p>According to sources within the Court, the decision was made in response to concerns that <a href="68-impeachment-war-looms-supreme-court-set-to-rule-on-fate.html">strategy games</a> were hindering the nation's ability to wage <a href="4-bombshell-discovery-shakes-election-history-scientists-uncover-evidence-of-secret.html">war</a> effectively. "We have to think about the bigger picture here," said Chief Justice John "JJ" Johnson. "If we can't even win at Risk, how are we supposed to take on our enemies?"</p>
<p>The decision has been met with widespread outrage from gamers across the country, who see it as a violation of their constitutional rights. "This is just ridiculous," said gamer and political activist, Jane Smith. "I have the right to play whatever game I want, and that includes <a href="20-breaking-democrats-unveil-revolutionary-science-based-government-strategy-game-to-secure.html">strategy games</a>. It's not like I'm going to start a <a href="34-breaking-mobile-games-take-center-stage-in-impeachment-hearings-dystopian.html">war</a> with my siblings over Monopoly."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, the <a href="63-drama-spills-house-democrats-plot-impeachment-over-controversial-taxation-move.html">House of Representatives</a> remains undeterred, with Speaker of the House, John "Hawk" Hawkins, saying that the ban is "a necessary measure to ensure the security of our great nation."</p>
<p>The ban will go into effect immediately, and those caught playing <a href="43-impeached-politician-secretly-develops-strategy-games-to-regain-power.html">strategy games</a> will face fines and even imprisonment. "We can't afford to take any chances here," said Attorney General, Mary "Maverick" Malloy. "We have to protect our country at all costs."</p>
<p>As the nation grapples with the implications of this decision, one thing is certain: <a href="49-breaking-new-evidence-exposes-global-elites-secret-tax-haven-scheme.html">war</a> has never been more dangerous.</p>

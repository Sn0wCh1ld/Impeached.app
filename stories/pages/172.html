<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bizarre turn of events, the <a href="145.html">United States</a> <a href="79.html">House of Representatives</a> has been transformed into a real-life version of the hit Netflix series "House of Cards." The satirical drama, which follows the Machiavellian machinations of a ruthless political operator, has seemingly come to life in the nation's capital.</p>
<p>As the 118th Congress convened earlier this week, lawmakers were greeted by the sight of their colleagues engaging in a series of bizarre and increasingly absurd power plays. From backroom deals to public meltdowns, the halls of Congress are now resembling a never-ending episode of the award-winning drama.</p>
<p>"It's like something out of a dream," said one long-time congressional staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity. "I've seen some pretty crazy things in my time here, but this is on a whole different level."</p>
<p>At the center of the drama is a shadowy figure, known only as "The Puppeteer." Sources close to the situation describe The Puppeteer as a master strategist who has been secretly manipulating the actions of lawmakers from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>"This guy is like Frank Underwood on steroids," said one Congressman, who wished to remain anonymous. "He's got a plan for everything, and he's not afraid to get his hands dirty."</p>
<p>As the days go by, the political machinations in Washington show no signs of slowing down. With the country's future hanging in the balance, it remains to be seen how long the current state of political chaos can be maintained.</p>
<p>"It's like a game of political chess, and everyone is trying to outmaneuver each other," said one political analyst. "But the question is, who will ultimately come out on top?"</p>
<p>In the meantime, the citizens of the <a href="92.html">United States</a> are left to wonder if their elected representatives have lost their minds. As the drama unfolds, one thing is clear: the world of politics will never be the same again.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

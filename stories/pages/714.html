<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a hidden trove of documents has been uncovered in the <a href="111.html">House of Representatives</a>, revealing a long-buried secret: the <a href="401.html">history</a> of <a href="51.html">taxation</a> in the very building where it was supposed to be avoided.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, the documents, which date back to the early days of the Republic, detail a series of clandestine meetings between House members and wealthy tax dodgers, where they hatched a plan to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.</p>
<p>"It's like a real-life episode of 'House of Cards,'" said one anonymous source, "but with more smoke-filled rooms and fewer Kevin Spacey-style monologues."</p>
<p>The documents, which include letters, receipts, and other paperwork, paint a picture of a systemic cover-up that has been in place for centuries.</p>
<p>"It seems that the <a href="694.html">House of Representatives</a> has been hiding a dirty little secret from the American people for centuries," said Rep. Tom Delay (R-TX), who was one of the first to uncover the conspiracy. "And I'm not just talking about the occasional campaign finance scandal."</p>
<p>According to the documents, some of the most influential members of Congress have been secretly working with some of the wealthiest tax dodgers in the country, using complex webs of shell companies and offshore bank accounts to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.</p>
<p>"It's like a game of fiscal limbo," said one former House staffer, who wished to remain anonymous. "You just keep dropping your tax burden lower and lower, until you're paying nothing at all."</p>
<p>The documents also reveal that some of the most outspoken critics of <a href="81.html">taxation</a> in the House have been secretly taking advantage of the very loopholes they've been campaigning against.</p>
<p>"It's like they're saying one thing and doing another," said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who was also implicated in the conspiracy. "But hey, who doesn't love a good tax loophole?"</p>
<p>The <a href="455.html">controversy</a> has already sparked outrage on both sides of the aisle, with some lawmakers calling for investigations and others demanding that their colleagues resign.</p>
<p>"This is a betrayal of the trust that the American people have placed in us," said Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). "We must do everything in our power to root out this corruption and restore faith in our government."</p>
<p>But others are calling foul, insisting that the revelations are just a political witch hunt.</p>
<p>"This is just another example of the partisan gridlock that's plaguing our country," said Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI). "We need to focus on the real issues, like how to avoid paying taxes legally."</p>
<p>As the scandal continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the <a href="477.html">history</a> of <a href="518.html">taxation</a> in the <a href="543.html">House of Representatives</a> is a lot more complicated than we ever could have imagined. And it looks like some of our elected representatives have been keeping a few secrets from us for a long time.</p>

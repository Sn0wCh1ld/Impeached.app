<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bold move to fund their ongoing <a href="414.html">war</a> against alien invaders, the Republican party has unveiled a revolutionary new plan: taxing intergalactic trade.</p>
<p>According to sources within the party, the plan involves establishing a special intergalactic trade <a href="519.html">taxation</a> agency, which will be responsible for collecting a small percentage of every transaction made between Earth-based businesses and their extraterrestrial counterparts.</p>
<p>"We're not just talking about a few scraps of space debris here," said Representative Zorg Z. Zorb (R-Plutonian), the plan's chief architect. "We're talking about a full-scale, multi-planetary economy. And we're going to tax that economy to the moon... and beyond!"</p>
<p>Critics have raised concerns about the plan's feasibility, pointing out that the vast majority of intergalactic trade is currently conducted through unregulated black markets. But <a href="494.html">Republicans</a> are undeterred, insisting that their plan will not only generate the revenue needed to fund the <a href="97.html">war</a> effort, but also serve as a powerful deterrent against any would-be invaders.</p>
<p>"Think about it," said Representative Zorb. "If an alien race is trying to invade us, and they're relying on intergalactic trade to fund their operations, well... we're just going to tax that trade right out from under them. It's like a... it's like a... strategy game, man!"</p>
<p>When asked about the potential backlash from other political parties, Zorb simply shrugged. "Look, folks, we're in a <a href="64.html">war</a>. And in times of <a href="244.html">war</a>, sometimes you gotta make some tough decisions. Like taxing intergalactic trade. It's not ideal, I'll admit it. But it's better than the alternative: getting invaded by aliens and having our planet turned into a giant space barbecue."</p>
<p>The plan has yet to receive a formal vote in Congress, but sources within the party suggest it's a "slam dunk" (or should we say, "slam dunkier"?).</p>
<p>In related news, the Democratic party has unveiled their own plan to fund the <a href="307.html">war</a> effort: a special "Alien Invasion Revenue Act," which would impose a small tax on all Earth-based transactions involving... well, everything.</p>
<p>"It's a bold move," said Representative Bortron B. Blorple (D-Mars). "But hey, when you're fighting an intergalactic <a href="317.html">war</a>, you gotta be bold. And we're not afraid to get our hands dirty... or in this case, our whole planet."</p>
<p>The bill is expected to face stiff opposition from <a href="11.html">Republicans</a>, who are already preparing their own counter-proposal: a "Tax the Aliens Before They Tax Us" amendment.</p>
<p>"It's simple," said Representative Zorb. "We tax them before they tax us. It's like a... it's like a... intergalactic tax cycle, man!"</p>
<p>Only time will tell if these plans will come to fruition. But one thing is for sure: the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance. And if these politicians have their way, it might be a while before we're all... taxed... into oblivion.</p>

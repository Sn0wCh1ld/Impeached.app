<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="17.html">House of Representatives</a> has announced plans to impeach <a href="264.html">President</a> James "Jim" Johnson over allegations of... wait for it... <a href="279.html">science</a> crimes!</p>
<p>Yes, you heard that right. The very same <a href="318.html">President</a> Johnson who has been a stalwart advocate for climate change action and vaccine mandates is now facing <a href="214.html">impeachment</a> proceedings due to his alleged misuse of scientific evidence.</p>
<p>According to sources within the Democratic Party, the <a href="248.html">President</a>'s alleged <a href="311.html">science</a> crimes include fudging temperature data to support his climate change agenda, cherry-picking studies to justify his vaccine mandates, and even... brace yourselves... using fake <a href="66.html">science</a> to win arguments with his wife during family game nights.</p>
<p>"We cannot stand idly by while this <a href="73.html">President</a> abuses the scientific process for his own political gain," said House Speaker Nancy "Nan" Pelosi in a statement. "We must hold him accountable for his actions and protect the integrity of <a href="22.html">science</a> in our great nation."</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! Sources close to the <a href="245.html">President</a> have revealed that he has been secretly funding a network of underground scientists who are conducting covert research on the effects of climate change on the world's supply of avocado toast. When reached for comment, the <a href="222.html">President</a>'s office denied any wrongdoing, but declined to comment on the avocado toast research.</p>
<p>As the <a href="143.html">impeachment</a> proceedings get underway, one thing is clear: this is a battle for the very soul of <a href="69.html">science</a> itself. Will the <a href="308.html">President</a> be held accountable for his alleged crimes against humanity? Or will he emerge victorious, his <a href="51.html">science</a>-based agenda intact? Only time will tell. Stay tuned!</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached
                        2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

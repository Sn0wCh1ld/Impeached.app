<p>In a shocking turn of events, the recently <a href="198.html">impeached</a> politician, former President James Johnson, has been accused of utilizing an unorthodox strategy to gain favor with the <a href="39.html">Supreme Court</a>. According to sources close to the former president, Johnson has been secretly training a team of chickens to sing the Constitution in an attempt to sway the Court's decision.</p>
<p>The plan, devised by Johnson's legal team, reportedly involves training the chickens to recite the First Amendment with exceptional clarity and precision, in the hopes that the Court will be impressed by the chickens' musical abilities. The chickens have been trained to sing the Constitution in its entirety, with a particular emphasis on the portions that protect individual liberties and limit government power.</p>
<p>"We knew we had to think outside the box when it came to defending President Johnson," said one of his legal advisors. "Singing the Constitution is the perfect way to show the Court that he truly believes in the principles of democracy and the rule of law."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of this unconventional strategy. "Chickens can't even spell the Constitution, let alone sing it," said a rival politician. "This is just a desperate attempt by Johnson to distract from his own incompetence and corruption."</p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, the former president remains optimistic about the outcome of his strategy. "I have faith in the power of music to bring people together and inspire greatness," he said in a statement. "I'm confident that the <a href="129.html">Supreme Court</a> will be moved by the chickens' performance and see the justice in my case."</p>
<p>The chickens, who have been trained in secret for months, are said to be ready to perform at a moment's notice. "We're confident that our Constitutional chicken rendition will be the most memorable and impactful argument the Court has ever heard," said one of their trainers.</p>
<p>The <a href="28.html">Supreme Court</a> is expected to issue its verdict on President Johnson's impeachment in the coming weeks. Will the chicken strategy pay off, or will it fall flat? Only time will tell.</p>

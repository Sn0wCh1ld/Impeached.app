<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the United States <a href="127.html">Senate</a> has passed a bill that grants the <a href="331.html">President</a> of the United States unlimited power to shape the future of humanity. The bill, which was proposed by <a href="248.html">President</a> Rachel McAdams (R-Ohio) and passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, allows the <a href="135.html">President</a> to make decisions on behalf of the entire human race without any oversight or accountability.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the White House, <a href="3.html">President</a> McAdams is "thrilled" with the passing of the bill and has already begun making plans to use her newfound power to shape the future of humanity in ways that "will blow your mind."</p>
<p>"This is a historic day for America and for the entire human race," <a href="23.html">President</a> McAdams declared in a statement. "With this new power, I will be able to ensure that humanity reaches its full potential and achieves greatness beyond anything we could have ever imagined."</p>
<p>The bill, which was dubbed the "Humanity-Shaping Act" by its proponents, was met with widespread support from both sides of the aisle in the <a href="30.html">Senate</a>. <a href="130.html">Republicans</a> hailed the bill as a "victory for American exceptionalism" and a "testament to the greatness of our democracy," while Democrats praised it as a "bold step towards a brighter future for all of humanity."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced that granting the <a href="170.html">President</a> unlimited power to shape the future of humanity is a good idea. Critics argue that the bill represents a clear violation of the Constitution and sets a dangerous precedent for the future of American democracy.</p>
<p>"This bill is a clear overreach of the <a href="280.html">President</a>'s authority and a threat to the very fabric of our democracy," said Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a vocal opponent of the bill. "We must not allow the <a href="54.html">President</a> to have unlimited power to shape the future of humanity without any oversight or accountability."</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the bill has already been signed into law by <a href="43.html">President</a> McAdams and is set to take effect immediately. The consequences of this new legislation remain to be seen, but one thing is certain - the future of humanity will never be the same.</p>

<p>Others, however, have praised the game for its bold take on the political system. "It's about time someone spoke truth to power," said <a href="8.html">gaming</a> enthusiast Sarah Satirized. "The game is a much-needed breath of fresh air in the stifling world of <a href="48.html">political games</a>."</p>

<p>IN a shocking turn of events, the <a href="52.html">Government</a> has announced new <a href="45.html">legislation</a> that would tax <a href="3.html">mobile games</a> in a <a href="22.html">dystopian</a> future. The bill, titled "The Greedy Gamer's Tax Act," aims to impose a hefty fee on every in-app purchase made in virtual worlds.</p>
<p>According to the bill's proponents, the tax is necessary to offset the cost of providing free content to the masses. "Without the Greedy Gamer's Tax, we would be burdened with the responsibility of funding our own entertainment," said one government official. "It's only fair that the gamers themselves foot the bill for their endless hours of thumb-twiddling."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. Critics argue that the tax would unfairly target those who can least afford it - the countless hours of free labor provided by mobile gamers. "This tax is nothing but a thinly-veiled attempt to exploit the working class," said a vocal protester. "We won't stand for it!"</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, the bill shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, some lawmakers are pushing for even more extreme measures. "Why stop at just taxing <a href="18.html">mobile games</a>?" asked one senator. "Why not tax the very air we breathe? It's only fair that the government profits from every single moment of our existence."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of mobile gaming is in jeopardy. Will the government's greed triumph, or will the masses rise up and demand their right to play for free? Only time will tell.</p>

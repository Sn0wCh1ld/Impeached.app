<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the once-mighty Democratic party is facing a full-blown communist revolt, sources reveal. As the party's leadership continues to grapple with internal conflicts and controversies, a growing number of members are secretly sympathizing with the red menace, sources say.</p>
<p>"It's like the party is being taken over by a bunch of delusional ideologues," said one senior Democratic strategist, who wished to remain anonymous. "They're so obsessed with tearing down the system, they don't realize they're actually helping the other side."</p>
<p>The signs of this insurrection have been subtly appearing for months, with party faithful whispering disapprovingly of the "bourgeoisie" and "capitalist" ideals that once defined the party's platform. Some have even been seen sporting red hats and toting copies of Mao's Little Red Book.</p>
<p>"It's like they're trying to out-Marx each other," chuckled one Republican strategist, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, seriously, who thought it was a good idea to make Karl Marx the face of the Democratic party?"</p>
<p>As tensions mount, some party leaders are warning of a growing rift within the ranks. "We're not a communist party," said one Democratic spokesperson. "We're a party that used to be Democratic."</p>
<p>But for many party members, the allure of communism is simply too strong to resist. "It's like a drug," said one disillusioned Democratic activist. "Once you take that first step towards Marx, there's no turning back."</p>
<p>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the Democratic party is facing a crisis of epic proportions. And if <a href="89.html">history</a> is any guide, it could be a long time before they recover from this latest attempt to "fundamentally transform" the <a href="6.html">United States</a>.</p>

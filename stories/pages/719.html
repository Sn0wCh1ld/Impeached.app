<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="685.html">impeached</a> President Thomas Jefferson III has announced his intention to ignore <a href="164.html">taxation</a> laws in the event of a <a href="355.html">dystopian</a> <a href="397.html">election</a> outcome. The president, who has been removed from office due to numerous scandals and impeachment proceedings, has vowed to take matters into his own hands if the <a href="503.html">election</a> does not go in his favor.</p>
<p>"Look, folks, I've been through a lot in the past year," President Jefferson III said in a press conference. "I've been <a href="163.html">impeached</a>, I've faced countless investigations, and I've even had to deal with those pesky <a href="26.html">taxation</a> laws. But let me tell you, if the American people don't see fit to elect me again, I'm not going to go down without a fight."</p>
<p>According to sources close to the president, he has been secretly planning a <a href="493.html">dystopian</a> takeover of the United States government. "He's been stockpiling weapons and supplies, and he's even been in talks with some shady characters from the criminal underworld," a White House insider revealed. "He's not going to let a little thing like impeachment stand in his way."</p>
<p>The president's plan involves ignoring all <a href="582.html">taxation</a> laws and instead, implementing a new system of "voluntary contributions." "People will have the option to give as much money as they want to the government, or face the consequences," a spokesperson for the president said. "It's a win-win situation."</p>
<p>Experts warn that this could lead to a constitutional crisis of epic proportions. "The president's actions are a clear violation of the <a href="585.html">Constitution</a> and could have severe consequences for the stability of our democracy," said <a href="716.html">Constitution</a>al Law Professor, Emily Johnson. "We urge the president to reconsider his plans and instead, focus on promoting unity and stability in the country."</p>
<p>But President Jefferson III remains unmoved. "I'm not afraid of a little crisis," he said with a smirk. "Besides, who needs the <a href="109.html">Constitution</a> when you've got a good set of hair gel and a strong sense of entitlement?"</p>
<p>As the country braced for a potential <a href="607.html">dystopian</a> takeover, citizens were left to wonder what could possibly go wrong. "I mean, it's not like the president has a history of, you know, getting things wrong," said one concerned citizen. "Oh wait, yes he does."</p>
<p>In any case, it seems that the fate of the United States hangs in the balance. Will President Jefferson III succeed in his <a href="424.html">dystopian</a> plans, or will he finally meet his match? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing crisis.</p>

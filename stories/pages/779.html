<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, recently <a href="385.html">impeached</a> <a href="748.html">Senate</a> Leader, Maxwell McSnark, has called for the implementation of scientific <a href="244.html">war</a> strategies in popular <a href="612.html">strategy games</a>.</p>
<p>"We've been playing these games for far too long with our pants on our heads," McSnark said in a press conference. "It's time to bring some real <a href="480.html">science</a> to the table."</p>
<p>McSnark, who was ousted from his position as <a href="718.html">Senate</a> Leader after a highly publicized impeachment trial, has reportedly been spending his spare time studying the latest advancements in military strategy and tactics.</p>
<p>"I mean, come on, folks," McSnark continued. "We're living in a time when the world is more unpredictable than ever. We need to think outside the box, and that means using some real <a href="311.html">science</a> to inform our gameplay."</p>
<p>According to sources close to McSnark, he has been secretly testing out his new strategy in popular games such as "Risk," "Chess," and "Monopoly."</p>
<p>"I've been using something called the 'McSnark Formula' to devastating effect," McSnark boasted. "It's a combination of quantum physics, chaos theory, and a little bit of voodoo. It's unbeatable."</p>
<p>When asked for further details on the McSnark Formula, McSnark cryptically replied, "You don't want to know. Trust me, you don't want to know."</p>
<p>The news has sent shockwaves through the gaming community, with many players expressing both excitement and trepidation at the prospect of scientific <a href="440.html">war</a> strategies infiltrating their favorite games.</p>
<p>"I can't believe it," gushed one gamer. "I've been playing 'Risk' the same way for years. This could totally change the game."</p>
<p>"On the other hand, I'm not sure I want to be invaded by a guy who's been <a href="667.html">impeached</a>," added another.</p>
<p>As for McSnark, he seems content to continue his newfound hobby, even if it means facing backlash from his political opponents.</p>
<p>"Hey, someone's got to bring some <a href="660.html">science</a> to this town," McSnark shrugged. "Might as well be me."</p>

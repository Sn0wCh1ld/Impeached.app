<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it appears that <a href="1.html">Congress</a> is engaging in a game of political chess, as the <a href="13.html">impeachment</a> showdown reaches new heights. Sources close to the situation have revealed that lawmakers are prioritizing their own interests over the future of democracy, as they strategize and maneuver for the ultimate prize: the fate of the nation.</p>
<p>As tensions rise and the clock ticks down, it's clear that the stakes are higher than ever before. The very foundation of government is at risk, as the political elite continues to play their games of power and manipulation.</p>
<p>But don't just take our word for it - here's what some key players had to say:</p>
<p>"I'm not concerned about the future of <a href="3.html">freedom</a>," said one influential lawmaker. "I'm concerned about my own political survival. After all, someone has to keep the government running, and that someone is me."</p>
<p>"Impeachment is just a tool for us to use against our political opponents," added a rival lawmaker. "We'll do whatever it takes to maintain our grip on power, even if it means sacrificing the principles that this country was founded upon."</p>
<p>As the drama unfolds, it's clear that the future of democracy hangs in the balance. Will <a href="15.html">Congress</a> put the needs of the people above their own selfish interests? Or will they continue to play their <a href="22.html">political games</a>, with the fate of the nation at stake? Only time will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached
                        2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

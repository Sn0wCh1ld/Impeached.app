<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="205.html">United States</a> Capitol building has been overrun by a group of rogue politicians, who have declared themselves the "<a href="97.html">Constitution</a>al <a href="56.html">Congress</a>." The group, led by self-proclaimed "Supreme Leader" Senator Ted Tumult, has stated their intention to rewrite the country's founding document, citing "outdated" provisions and "bad ideas."</p>
<p>According to insiders, the move is not entirely unexpected, as the current <a href="103.html">Congress</a> has been embroiled in bitter infighting for months, with many members refusing to compromise on even the most basic legislation. "It's like they've forgotten how to govern," said one anonymous source. "I mean, who needs checks and balances when you can just declare yourself dictator for life?"</p>
<p>The "<a href="57.html">Constitution</a>al <a href="221.html">Congress</a>" has already begun drafting a new document, which reportedly includes provisions for universal healthcare, free college tuition, and the legalization of marijuana. However, some critics have expressed concern that the new document may include provisions for, gasp, "socialism."</p>
<p>As the situation in Washington continues to deteriorate, many have drawn parallels with the early days of the <a href="39.html">United States</a>, when the founding fathers themselves were embroiled in a bitter struggle over the country's future. "It's like <a href="32.html">history</a> is repeating itself," said one political analyst. "Except this time, the founding fathers are wearing avocado toast and ripped jeans."</p>
<p>In related news, the White House has issued a statement condemning the "<a href="281.html">Constitution</a>al <a href="114.html">Congress</a>" as a "coup" and a "threat to democracy." However, sources close to the administration have admitted that President Joe Jumble is secretly thrilled at the prospect of a new, more progressive constitution. "I mean, who doesn't want free college tuition and legal weed?" said one administration insider. "Am I right, folks?"</p>
<p>As the situation in Washington continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the <a href="120.html">United States</a> is in for a wild and unpredictable ride. Stay tuned for further updates from the "<a href="5.html">Constitution</a>al <a href="1.html">Congress</a>" and its "Supreme Leader," Senator Ted Tumult. Will they succeed in their bid to rewrite the <a href="94.html">Constitution</a>? Only time will tell. Or, you know, until they get bored and go play a strategy game.</p>

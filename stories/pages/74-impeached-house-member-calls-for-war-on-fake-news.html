<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="74-impeached-house-member-calls-for-<a href="34-breaking-mobile-games-take-center-stage-in-impeachment-hearings-dystopian.html">war</a>-on-fake-news.html">impeached</a> House Member John Smith has called for a full-scale <a href="33-congress-declares-war-on-disaster-house-votes-unanimously-for-total.html">war</a> on "Fake News" during a heated press conference yesterday.</p>
<p>"We cannot sit idly by while lies and misinformation are spread throughout our great nation," Smith declared, his voice trembling with righteous indignation. "It's time to take drastic action, and I'm not afraid to say it: we need to declare <a href="42-history-shocker-house-of-representatives-votes-to-abolish-freedom-paves-way.html">war</a> on Fake News!"</p>
<p>The assembled reporters gasped in surprise, wondering how the embattled lawmaker could possibly think that launching a <a href="73-war-in-america-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-house.html">war</a> would solve his own impeachment troubles. However, Smith remained undeterred, his eyes flashing with determination.</p>
<p>"I know what you're thinking," he continued. "You're thinking, 'John, how can you possibly expect to win a <a href="58-breaking-president-accused-of-corruption-in-shocking-new-allegations--.html">war</a> against Fake News? It's a slippery slope, a never-ending battle!' But let me tell you, my fellow Americans, I have a plan. We'll mobilize our best journalists, our brightest minds, and we'll fight this <a href="49-breaking-new-evidence-exposes-global-elites-secret-tax-haven-scheme.html">war</a> with every weapon at our disposal – from fact-checking to satire!"</p>
<p>At this point, a reporter from the Daily Dribble poked their head into the press conference, looking confused. "Um, John, I think you might want to reconsider your position on this whole '<a href="57-war-games-shocker-new-political-strategy-could-change-the-course.html">war</a> on Fake News' thing. I mean, haven't you heard? Fake News is actually a pretty cool podcast these days. Maybe you should give it a listen?"</p>
<p>Smith's face turned beet-red with rage. "How dare you question my judgment, you insolent hack!" he bellowed. "I'll have you know, I've been listening to Fake News for years, and it's been a valuable source of information and entertainment. But now, it seems they're using their platform to spread lies and propaganda! It's a travesty, I tell you!"</p>
<p>As the press conference descended into chaos, Smith's eyes gleamed with a manic intensity. "I'll show them all, I'll show them who's boss! I'll take on Fake News and I'll win! And when I do, this great nation will finally be free from the scourge of false information!"</p>
<p>When asked for a comment, Representative Jane Doe from the opposing party shook her head sadly. "It's just another example of how our political discourse has devolved into a farce. Instead of working together to solve real problems, we're busy waging <a href="4-bombshell-discovery-shakes-election-history-scientists-uncover-evidence-of-secret.html">war</a> on made-up ones. It's a sad day for America, that's for sure."</p>
<p>And so, the stage is set for what promises to be a long and grueling conflict – one that could very well determine the fate of our nation. Will Smith emerge victorious, or will he be defeated by the formidable forces of Fake News? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for further updates from the War on Fake News frontlines!</p>

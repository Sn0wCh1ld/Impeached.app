<p>Washington D.C. - In a historic and groundbreaking move, the <a href="38.html">House of Representatives</a> has passed a bill aimed at eradicating corrupt <a href="51.html">taxation</a> practices and upholding the long-standing tradition of <a href="2.html">freedom</a> in the United States. The bill, known as the "Freedom from Corruption Act," has been hailed as a major victory for the American people and a stern warning to those who seek to undermine the integrity of the nation's tax system.</p>
<p>According to sources, the bill was passed with a resounding majority, with not a single member of the opposition present to dissent. The legislation seeks to end the practice of taxing citizens based on their income, which has been deemed unconstitutional by many legal scholars.</p>
<p>"This is a momentous day in the <a href="16.html">history</a> of our great nation," declared House Speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi. "For too long, the American people have been held hostage by the corrupt and oppressive <a href="50.html">taxation</a> practices of the past. Today, we take a bold step towards a brighter future, where <a href="42.html">freedom</a> and liberty are the guiding principles of our tax code."</p>
<p>The bill's passage has been met with widespread celebration and jubilation, with many citizens taking to the streets to express their gratitude. "I can't believe this is finally happening," exclaimed one ecstatic protester. "No more being nickel and dimed by the government! No more being treated like a slave to the tax man!"</p>
<p>But not everyone is celebrating the bill's passage. Critics have emerged from the shadows, warning of the dangers of ending income <a href="26.html">taxation</a>. "This is a slippery slope, my friends," warned one vocal opponent. "Once we give up this revenue stream, where will it end? The sky's the limit, I tell you!"</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the majority of lawmakers remain resolute in their stance. "We cannot continue to be held hostage by the whims of special interest groups and the corrupt practices of the past," declared Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. "It is time for a change, and this bill is the first step towards a brighter future for all Americans."</p>
<p>As the bill now heads to the Senate for approval, the nation waits with bated breath to see if this bold move towards <a href="6.html">freedom</a> and liberty will be the beginning of a new era in American politics. One thing is certain: the status quo is no more, and the people have spoken loud and clear on this issue. The question is, will the powers that be listen? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Democratic party has announced a far-reaching economic plan aimed at saving the world from the brink of collapse. The plan, dubbed "The Science War Initiative," has been met with widespread criticism and skepticism from both sides of the aisle, with some calling it the most <a href="40.html">dystopian</a> proposal to come out of Washington in recent memory.</p>
<p>At the heart of the plan is a bold declaration of <a href="113.html">war</a> on <a href="68.html">science</a> itself. According to the proposal, the only way to save humanity from the myriad of challenges it faces, including climate change, economic inequality, and social injustice, is to completely dismantle the scientific method and replace it with a new, more effective framework for decision-making.</p>
<p>"We've tried the old ways of doing things, and they've clearly failed," said Democratic leader Sen. Jane Smith, in a statement. "It's time to take a bold leap into the unknown and trust our instincts over the cold, hard facts. After all, who needs facts when you have faith?"</p>
<p>Under the plan, all scientific research and development would be immediately ceased, and scientists would be redeployed to work on projects deemed more pressing by the party's leaders. These projects include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>* Building a massive wall around the United States to keep out "dirty" immigrants from other countries.</p>
<p>* Creating a new form of currency that can only be spent on goods and services that promote "positive" social values, such as "unity" and "patriotism."</p>
<p>* Establishing a national program to eliminate all forms of "wrongthink" and "hate speech," including but not limited to, "climate change denial," "social justice activism," and "skepticism."</p>
<p>* Providing free mental health treatment for all citizens, in order to combat the perceived "mental health crisis" plaguing the nation.</p>
<p>* Implementing a "Basic Income" program, where every citizen would be guaranteed a minimum standard of living, regardless of their productivity or contribution to society.</p>
<p>While the plan has sparked intense debate and outrage among both sides of the political aisle, some critics have pointed out that it may have unintended consequences, such as creating a culture of "ignorance and compliance," and promoting a "mediocrity"-based economy, where the only measure of success is how well one can "fake it."</p>
<p>Others have raised concerns about the plan's compatibility with existing international treaties and agreements, including the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the Democratic party remains steadfast in their support for the plan, insisting that it is the only way to "save the world" from itself. As one party leader put it, "We're not afraid to take bold action, even if it means sacrificing a few principles along the way."</p>
<p>The Science War Initiative is expected to be voted on in Congress next week, where it is expected to face strong opposition from both sides of the aisle. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>

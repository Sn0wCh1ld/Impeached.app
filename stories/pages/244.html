<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the United States government has been plunged into chaos after a full-blown <a href="235.html">war</a> broke out between <a href="37.html">President</a> Thomas Jefferson and the <a href="12.html">Constitution</a>. The conflict, which began early yesterday morning, has left the capital city in a state of utter confusion and destruction.</p>
<p>Sources close to the situation revealed that the <a href="54.html">President</a>, incensed by the <a href="65.html">Constitution</a>'s repeated attempts to limit his powers, launched a surprise attack on the document just after midnight. "He was fed up with those archaic rules and regulations, and he wasn't going to take it anymore," said a White House spokesperson on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The <a href="151.html">Constitution</a>, which has been the cornerstone of American democracy for over two centuries, fought back with all its might. But despite its formidable legal arguments and checks and balances, the document was no match for the <a href="163.html">President</a>'s sheer willpower and determination.</p>
<p>As the <a href="24.html">war</a> rages on, the city's residents are living in a state of panic. "I never thought I'd see the day where the <a href="136.html">President</a> and the <a href="94.html">Constitution</a> were at each other's throats," said local resident Jane Smith. "It's like something out of a bad sci-fi movie."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Congress, which has been largely silent on the matter, is said to be secretly negotiating a peace treaty. "They're trying to find a way to end the <a href="14.html">war</a> without losing too much power," said a congressional aide.</p>
<p>The <a href="199.html">war</a> between the <a href="51.html">President</a> and the <a href="20.html">Constitution</a> has left many questions unanswered, including how this conflict will affect the upcoming election, and whether the country will be able to recover from the damage caused by the <a href="171.html">war</a>.</p>
<p>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the United States government will never be the same again.</p>

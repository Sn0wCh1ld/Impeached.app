<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="37.html">Supreme Court</a> has ruled in favor of an alien invasion in a landmark decision that has left many Americans reeling. The unanimous decision, which was handed down early this morning, overturns a longstanding ban on extraterrestrial immigration and paves the way for an influx of visitors from beyond our planet.</p>
<p>According to sources within the Court, the decision was reached after a thorough examination of the latest scientific evidence, which suggests that the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is no longer a matter of speculation, but a scientific fact.</p>
<p>"The evidence is clear," said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in a statement. "The universe is teeming with life, and it is our duty to embrace and celebrate this incredible discovery."</p>
<p>The decision has sparked widespread debate and controversy, with many Americans expressing concerns about the potential consequences of an alien invasion. However, proponents of the decision argue that it is a necessary step to<a href="153.html">war</a>ds a more inclusive and diverse society.</p>
<p>"This is a momentous day for humanity," said Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ), a vocal proponent of the decision. "By opening our borders to the cosmos, we are embracing the future and welcoming the next great chapter in our evolution as a species."</p>
<p>The decision has also sparked a flurry of activity in the political sphere, with several high-profile politicians already announcing their intention to run for office on a platform of intergalactic cooperation.</p>
<p>"The time for isolationism is over," said Presidential candidate Andrew Yang (D-NY). "It's time to embrace the vast possibilities of the universe and work to<a href="293.html">war</a>ds a brighter future for all life, everywhere."</p>
<p>As the news of the decision spreads, Americans are bracing themselves for the arrival of their new celestial neighbors. While some are excited at the prospect of meeting beings from other worlds, others are more skeptical, worrying about the potential consequences of an alien invasion.</p>
<p>But one thing is certain - the world will never be the same again. As the universe comes knocking on our door, it's time to ask ourselves - are we ready for the next great adventure?</p>

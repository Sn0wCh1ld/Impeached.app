<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="71.html">Senate</a> is set to upend the <a href="49.html">Constitution</a> with their latest tax reform plan. According to sources, the proposal would effectively abolish the 16th Amendment, which grants Congress the power to tax income.</p>
<p>"This is a game-changer," said Senator John Smith (R-Ohio), the lead negotiator on the bill. "For too long, the <a href="76.html">Constitution</a> has held us back. It's time to take a bold step forward and give the American people the tax relief they deserve."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. Critics argue that the plan is a thinly veiled attempt to give the wealthy a tax break at the expense of the poor and middle class.</p>
<p>"This is a blatant power grab by the wealthy elite," said Senator Jane Doe (D-Calif.). "We cannot allow them to further entrench their power and wealth at the expense of the majority of Americans."</p>
<p>The plan is expected to face stiff opposition in the <a href="88.html">Supreme Court</a>, which has a history of upholding the <a href="78.html">Constitution</a>. But with the Court now stacked with conservative justices, the outcome is far from certain.</p>
<p>"This is a risky move, but it's one we have to make," said Senator Smith. "The American people are crying out for change, and we're delivering."</p>
<p>The bill is expected to pass the <a href="101.html">Senate</a> in the coming weeks, and will then be sent to the House of Representatives for approval. If signed into law, it would mark the first time in American history that the <a href="97.html">Constitution</a> has been formally amended to benefit the wealthy.</p>
<p>As the country watches anxiously, one thing is clear: the political landscape is about to change forever.</p>

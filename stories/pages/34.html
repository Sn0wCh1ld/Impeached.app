<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="31.html">Congress</a> has proposed a constitutional amendment that has left scientists and citizens alike scratching their heads. The amendment, which aims to outlaw gravity, has been met with widespread criticism and skepticism, but its proponents remain adamant that it is necessary to "protect the rights of individuals" and "promote economic growth."</p>
<p>According to the proposed amendment, gravity, the fundamental force that governs the behavior of objects on Earth, would be declared "unconstitutional" and "in violation of the principles of individual freedom and autonomy." The amendment goes on to state that "no person or entity shall be subject to the force of gravity, except insofar as it is necessary for the conduct of space exploration and development."</p>
<p>Scientists have been quick to point out the obvious flaws in the amendment, citing the devastating consequences that would result from the sudden loss of gravity. "Gravity is what keeps us on the ground," explains Dr. Jane Smith, a renowned physicist. "Without it, we would float off into space, never to be seen again."</p>
<p>Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence against the amendment, its proponents remain undeterred. "We have to think about the bigger picture," says Rep. John Doe, a leading proponent of the amendment. "By outlawing gravity, we can create a more equal society, where everyone has the opportunity to soar to new heights."</p>
<p>Critics of the amendment have pointed out that it is unclear how the proposed ban on gravity would be enforced, particularly in light of the vast distances and lack of infrastructure in space. "How exactly do you plan to police the universe?" asks Dr. Smith.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, it remains to be seen whether <a href="30.html">Congress</a> will be able to muster the support necessary to pass the amendment. One thing is certain, however: if it does, the consequences will be felt far beyond the halls of <a href="24.html">Congress</a>.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

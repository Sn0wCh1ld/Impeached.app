<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="209.html">Congress</a> is considering a controversial proposal to revive ancient <a href="229.html">taxation</a> methods in order to fund future historical preservation efforts. The proposal, which has been gaining momentum in recent weeks, aims to levy taxes on citizens based on their social status, occupation, and personal possessions.</p>
<p>According to sources within <a href="26.html">Congress</a>, the idea behind this proposal is to create a more "equitable" and "sustainable" system of <a href="185.html">taxation</a>. "Why should the wealthy and powerful be exempt from paying their fair share?" asked Representative Maxwell of Ohio. "By taxing them based on their social standing, we can ensure that everyone contributes to the upkeep of our nation's <a href="7.html">history</a>."</p>
<p>However, critics of the proposal argue that it is a step backward in terms of progress and fairness. "This is not the 14th century, folks," said Representative Rachel of California. "We need to focus on creating a more inclusive and modern system of <a href="92.html">taxation</a>, not regressing to outdated and oppressive methods."</p>
<p>Under the proposed system, citizens would be categorized into different classes based on their social status, such as "noble," "gentry," and "commoner." Each class would be taxed at a different rate, with the wealthiest and most influential individuals paying the highest taxes.</p>
<p>But the proposal doesn't stop there. In an effort to ensure that <a href="51.html">history</a> is preserved for future generations, <a href="11.html">Congress</a> is also considering a new "Time Tax" on citizens. "We want to make sure that people are aware of and appreciate their place in <a href="231.html">history</a>," explained Representative John of Texas. "By taxing them based on their time on this earth, we can encourage them to make the most of their time and contribute to society in meaningful ways."</p>
<p>While the proposal has sparked heated debates among lawmakers and citizens alike, it remains to be seen how it will play out in the coming months. One thing is for sure, however - the future of <a href="181.html">taxation</a> in America will never be the same.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

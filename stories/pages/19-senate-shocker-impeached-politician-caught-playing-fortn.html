<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, an <a href="3-constitutional-disaster-will-impeached-politicians-actions-lead-to-supreme-court.html">impeached</a> politician has been caught red-handed (literally) engaging in a controversial activity that has left many in <a href="2-congress-uncovers-shocking-history-of-taxation-corruption-new-findings-reveal.html">Congress</a> scratching their heads.</p>
<p>According to sources within the Capitol Building, Senator John Smith, who was impeached last month for allegedly using his position for personal gain, was caught playing the popular video game Fortnite in a secret underground bunker deep beneath the <a href="19-senate-shocker-impeached-politician-caught-playing-fortn.html">Senate</a> chambers.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Smith denied any wrongdoing, claiming that he was simply "testing out the latest scientific advancements in the field of <a href="17-impeachment-invasion-constitutional-crisis-looms-as-gaming-simulation-predicts-future.html">gaming</a>."</p>
<p>However, sources close to the situation say that the Senator had been using the game to escape the stress of his impeachment proceedings, which have been ongoing for weeks.</p>
<p>"It's no surprise that John was caught playing Fortnite," said one aide on condition of anonymity. "He's been under a lot of pressure lately, and let's face it, the game is just plain addictive."</p>
<p>But the situation has raised eyebrows among some of Smith's colleagues, who are concerned that the Senator may have been using the game to avoid his duties as a lawmaker.</p>
<p>"As a member of <a href="7-breaking-us-government-secretly-funding-mobile-game-developers-to-influence.html">Congress</a>, it's important for our representatives to be fully focused on their work and responsibilities," said Representative Jane Doe. "If Senator Smith was using Fortnite as a way to avoid his duties, that's a serious breach of protocol and could undermine the trust of the American people."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, Smith remains defiant, insisting that he will continue to play Fortnite in his spare time.</p>
<p>"Let's be real, folks," he said in a statement. "Gaming is the future of politics. If I can't adapt to the times, then I'm not doing my job."</p>
<p>As the drama continues to unfold, one thing is certain: Fortnite is no longer just a game for kids and teenagers. It's now a full-fledged political scandal that could change the face of American politics forever. Stay tuned for more updates from the bustling world of Washington D.C. politics.</p>

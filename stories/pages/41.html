                <p></p>
<p>In the not-too-distant future, the United States government had finally achieved its ultimate goal: a complete and utter dismantling of democracy. With each passing year, the once-hallowed halls of Congress became more and more empty, as cunning politicians manipulated their way into positions of power, using every trick in the book to remain there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Washington D.C., a strange and ominous structure began to rise from the earth like some grotesque monument to hubris itself - The Constitution Conspiracy. It was said that within those towering walls lurked dark forces beyond comprehension; forces ancient and powerful enough to warp even the fabric of reality itself.</p>
<p>Desperate for answers, a small group of brave souls dared venture forth towards this unholy abomination, only to discover what horrifying secrets it held. They found themselves trapped in an eerie labyrinth filled with ghostly apparitions of America's founding fathers, each one whispering maddening prophecies of doom and despair.</p>
<p>As they delved deeper into the nightmare landscape, one by one they succumbed to the all-consuming darkness within - until none remained but one shattered individual; left alone to confront The Constitution Conspiracy's insidious mastermind: a shadowy figure cloaked in the very fabric of history itself...</p>
<p>Will he emerge victorious? Or will this latest descent into horror become his own personal damnation? Only time would tell as our hapless hero faced off against this malevolent monstrosity that had risen from the deepest depths of America's collective psyche.</p>
<p>The stage was set for an epic showdown between forces of freedom and those hell-bent on eradicating it - with no one certain who would emerge triumphant. Would justice prevail, or be consumed by an unquenchable thirst for power ? The Constitution Conspiracy was about to deliver its final verdict...</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>
                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

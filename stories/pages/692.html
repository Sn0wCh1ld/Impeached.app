<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="169.html">House of Representatives</a> has been plagued by allegations of <a href="534.html">corruption</a> and misconduct. The once-vaunted institution, known for its noble ideals and unwavering commitment to the people, has been rocked by accusations of embezzlement, bribery, and outright thievery.</p>
<p>At the center of the storm is none other than Speaker of the House, Paul "The Great" Pendergast. Long known for his silver tongue and charisma, Pendergast has been accused of using his position to enrich himself and his closest allies. "He's been living the high life on the backs of hardworking Americans," said one anonymous staffer. "It's like he's running a personal fiefdom up there."</p>
<p>But Pendergast isn't the only one in hot water. Several other members of <a href="580.html">Congress</a> have been implicated in the scandal, including Sen. Jane "The Tax Queen" Thompson and Rep. Alex "The Swamp Fox" Rodriguez. Thompson has been accused of using her position to benefit her wealthy donors, while Rodriguez has been accused of using his influence to line his own pockets.</p>
<p>The allegations have sparked outrage among the public, with many calling for the resignation of all involved. "These people are supposed to be representing us, not lining their own pockets," said one angry citizen. "It's time for them to be held accountable."</p>
<p>But don't worry, folks - the good folks at <a href="518.html">Congress</a> aren't going down without a fight. They've been busy passing legislation left and right, all designed to help them skirt accountability and keep their lucrative little game going. "It's like they're trying to create a whole new level of <a href="583.html">corruption</a>," said one political analyst. "It's like a never-ending cycle of greed and abuse of power."</p>
<p>And as if things couldn't get any worse, it seems that the entire institution has become mired in a never-ending cycle of bickering and infighting. "It's like they're all trying to outdo each other in a game of political one-upmanship," said one fed-up citizen. "They're more interested in scoring points than actually doing their jobs."</p>
<p>So there you have it, folks. The <a href="365.html">House of Representatives</a>: where <a href="253.html">corruption</a> and greed know no bounds, and the people pay the price. But hey, at least they're still good at one thing: <a href="164.html">taxation</a>.</p>

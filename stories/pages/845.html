<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has come to light that the Republican party has been secretly plotting a revolutionary new <a href="143.html">taxation</a> scheme to finally fix <a href="542.html">Congress</a> once and for all. According to sources within the party, the plan involves taxing every American citizen a small fortune, with the funds generated being used to directly bribe every member of <a href="562.html">Congress</a> to leave their positions and never come back.</p>
<p>"It's a bold move, but we're confident it will work," said a senior Republican strategist on condition of anonymity. "After all, who can resist a nice, juicy bribe? It's like a political version of a free buffet - everyone's a winner."</p>
<p>The plan, known as "Operation: Reset <a href="386.html">Congress</a>," involves creating a new tax bracket specifically designed to target the wealthiest members of society. This "<a href="347.html">Congress</a> Tax" would see individuals earning over $500,000 per year paying a whopping 100% of their income in taxes.</p>
<p>But don't worry, the <a href="672.html">Republicans</a> are quick to assure, the tax revenue generated will be used for a "noble and worthy" purpose - bribing every member of <a href="301.html">Congress</a> to leave their positions and never come back.</p>
<p>"Think of it as a political version of a golden parachute," said the strategist. "We're giving them a chance to gracefully exit politics and live out the rest of their days in luxury, free from the pesky burdens of governing."</p>
<p>While the plan may seem far-fetched, some have praised the Republican party for their innovative approach to fixing <a href="99.html">Congress</a>.</p>
<p>"Finally, someone is taking bold action to address the root of the problem," said political analyst Dr. Jane Smith. "It's time for <a href="145.html">Congress</a> to be held accountable for their inaction and lack of accountability. If this plan works, it could be a game-changer."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced of the plan's success.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure if this is the best way to go about fixing <a href="518.html">Congress</a>," said Democratic strategist John Doe. "It's a bit...unorthodox, don't you think? Maybe they should try actually addressing the issues facing the country instead of just bribing people to leave."</p>
<p>But the <a href="197.html">Republicans</a> are undeterred, confident that their plan will be the key to finally fixing the political stalemate that has gripped Washington D.C. for far too long.</p>
<p>"It's time for a change," said the strategist. "And if that means bribing every member of <a href="190.html">Congress</a> to leave, then so be it. At least then we can finally get some real work done around here."</p>

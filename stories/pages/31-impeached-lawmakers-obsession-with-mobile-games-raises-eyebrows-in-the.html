<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, an <a href="31-impeached-lawmakers-obsession-with-mobile-games-raises-eyebrows-in-the.html">impeached</a> lawmaker has been found to have a secret obsession with <a href="7-breaking-us-government-secretly-funding-mobile-game-developers-to-influence.html">mobile games</a>. The lawmaker, known only as "Representative Jones," has been accused of spending hours upon hours playing games on his personal device during <a href="29-revealed-secret-deal-shakes-republican-party-to-its-core-impacting.html">House of Representatives</a> meetings.</p>
<p>"It's like he's trapped in a time loop, reliving the same game over and over again," said one colleague, who wished to remain anonymous. "He'll be in the middle of a heated debate, and then suddenly his eyes glaze over and he's tapping away on his phone."</p>
<p>According to sources, Representative Jones has been playing a wide variety of games, including puzzle games, strategy games, and even some more...adult-oriented titles.</p>
<p>"He's always been a bit of a gamer, but this is just ridiculous," said another colleague. "I mean, I've seen him stay up until 3am playing Clash of Clans. Who does that?"</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, Representative Jones remains defiant, insisting that his love of <a href="12-senate-passes-landmark-legislation-to-regulate-mobile-games-industry-amidst.html">mobile games</a> is not only a harmless hobby, but a glimpse into the future of politics.</p>
<p>"The world is changing, my friends," he said in a statement. "And I for one am excited to see where this new frontier of <a href="25-democrats-enter-dystopian-gaming-world-to-predict-<a href="17-impeachment-invasion-constitutional-crisis-looms-as-gaming-simulation-predicts-future.html">impeachment</a>-outcome-will.html">futurism</a> takes us. Who needs to actually govern when you can just hack your way to victory?"</p>
<p>As the scandal continues to unfold, one thing is clear: Representative Jones is not going down without a fight...or at least, without a well-equipped army of virtual soldiers.</p>

<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a secret plot to overthrow the <a href="328.html">Supreme Court</a> has been uncovered in the halls of Congress. According to sources within the <a href="382.html">Senate</a>, a group of rogue lawmakers have been secretly planning a coup to seize control of the highest court in the land.</p>
<p>The plot, which has been in the works for months, involves a coordinated effort between <a href="62.html">Senate</a> Majority Leader, Senator McSnarky, and a group of like-minded legislators to undermine the Court's authority and install their own handpicked justices.</p>
<p>"It's a bold move, but we're confident it will pay off," said Senator McSnarky in a statement. "The Court has become too independent and out of touch with the American people. It's time for a change."</p>
<p>The plan, which has been code-named "Operation Court-Coup," involves a series of covert maneuvers to undermine the Court's legitimacy and pave the way for a new, more compliant bench.</p>
<p>According to sources, the <a href="360.html">Senate</a> has been secretly gathering intelligence on the Court's justices, looking for any vulnerabilities that can be exploited. They have also been discreetly funneling money to key <a href="17.html">House of Representatives</a> members in order to influence their votes on crucial legislation.</p>
<p>"It's a risky move, but we have to do what it takes to protect our interests," said Senator McSnarky. "The Court has become a real threat to our democracy, and we can't let it continue to operate unchecked."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced of the <a href="334.html">Senate</a>'s motives. Critics say that the plot is a clear violation of the Constitution and could lead to a constitutional crisis.</p>
<p>"This is a dangerous precedent that could undermine the very fabric of our democracy," said constitutional law expert, Professor Plumb. "The <a href="127.html">Senate</a>'s actions are a direct attack on the separation of powers and could lead to a constitutional showdown."</p>
<p>As the situation unfolds, one thing is clear: the political stakes have never been higher, and the future of the <a href="65.html">Supreme Court</a> hangs in the balance. Stay tuned for further updates from the bustling halls of Congress.</p>

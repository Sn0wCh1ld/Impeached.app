<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bold move that has left many scratching their heads, newly <a href="405.html">impeached</a> President Franklin Delano Roosevelt has announced that he will be purposefully ignoring the scientific consensus in favor of "<a href="474.html">freedom</a> of <a href="544.html">gaming</a>."</p>
<p>In a press conference held at the White House, President Roosevelt stated, "look, folks, I know some of you out there are worried about the <a href="440.html">science</a>, but let me tell you something - <a href="330.html">freedom</a> of <a href="83.html">gaming</a> is a fundamental right, and I'm not about to let a little thing like facts get in the way of that."</p>
<p>When asked to clarify his stance, President Roosevelt continued, "I mean, come on, have you seen the latest Fortnite update? It's like a whole new game! And let's be real, who needs to know about climate change when you can be a professional gamer? It's all about the Benjamins, baby!"</p>
<p>Despite the outcry from scientists and concerned citizens, President Roosevelt remains steadfast in his position. "Look, I'm not saying I don't care about the environment, but let's be real, it's not as important as my Fortnite skills. And besides, if we're going to save the planet, we need to think outside the box - or in this case, the game. Freedom of <a href="505.html">gaming</a> is the future, and I'm not going to let anyone tell me otherwise."</p>
<p>As for his political opponents, President Roosevelt has a simple message: "bring it on. I've got my trusty controller and my A-game. Let's see them try to take me down in a game of Call of Duty."</p>
<p>In related news, President Roosevelt has announced plans to hold a <a href="318.html">gaming</a> tournament at the White House, with the winner receiving a special prize - a personalized Fortnite skin featuring the President's face.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Vice President Kamala Harris was seen muttering under her breath, "this guy's got to go."</p>
<p>But hey, at least he's still got his chill – and his <a href="564.html">gaming</a> skills.</p>

<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a team of scientists from the prestigious Institute of Unnecessary Research has made a groundbreaking discovery in the hallowed halls of <a href="86.html">Congress</a>. After conducting a series of rigorous experiments, the scientists have conclusively proven that the <a href="372.html">House of Representatives</a> is on the brink of an impending <a href="696.html">disaster</a>.</p>
<p>According to the lead researcher, Dr. Agatha Buttah, "We were shocked to discover that the cumulative effects of political posturing, self-serving legislation, and flagrant disregard for the scientific method have reached a critical point. It's a miracle that <a href="24.html">Congress</a> has managed to function at all."</p>
<p>The team used a complex algorithm to analyze the transcripts of every single speech delivered in the House chamber since its inception, as well as a detailed analysis of the cafeteria menu. The results were alarming: the combined weight of the food consumed by <a href="472.html">Congress</a> has reached a critical mass, causing the floor to become dangerously unstable.</p>
<p>"It's not just the weight of the food," warned Dr. Buttah. "The sheer volume of hot air emanating from the chamber has created a vortex that threatens to suck the entire building into a parallel dimension."</p>
<p>The scientists have recommended immediate action to avert the impending <a href="220.html">disaster</a>. "We urge <a href="139.html">Congress</a> to take immediate steps to reduce the weight of the food consumed in the chamber, such as replacing fried chicken with baked sweet potatoes, and limiting the amount of pizza delivery to once a week," said Dr. Buttah.</p>
<p><a href="597.html">Congress</a>man Bob Blowhard, a prominent member of the House, dismissed the findings as "just another attempt by the elite scientists to undermine the democratic process." When asked for his response to the impending <a href="470.html">disaster</a>, he simply chuckled and muttered, "Pizza delivery will save us all."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the scientific community is calling for a moratorium on all new legislation until the crisis is averted. "We can't afford to take any chances," said Dr. Buttah. "The fate of the nation hangs in the balance."</p>
<p>In related news, the President has announced a new initiative to create a national park dedicated to the study of hot air. "We must recognize the importance of this phenomenon," said the President. "After all, who needs a functional government when we have hot air?"</p>
<p>The discovery has sent shockwaves throughout the political landscape, with both parties scrambling to exploit the situation for political gain. "This is the perfect opportunity for us to show the American people that we're the only ones who can save them," said a spokesperson for the opposing party.</p>
<p>As the crisis deepens, the scientists are urging the public to stay calm and follow their instructions. "We're doing everything we can to avert this <a href="378.html">disaster</a>," said Dr. Buttah. "But let's be real, at this point, it's probably too late."</p>

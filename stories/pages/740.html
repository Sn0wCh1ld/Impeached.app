<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the government has revealed a secret plan to tank the economy and spark a revolution, sources close to the matter have confirmed. The plan, which has been in the works for months, is said to be a last-ditch effort to impeach President Johnson and install a new administration.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the plan involves a series of legislative maneuvers designed to cripple the economy and create widespread unrest. "The goal is to make the country so unstable that the public will demand drastic action," said one source, who wished to remain anonymous. "We're talking economic collapse, mass protests, and maybe even some civil unrest. It's going to be a real mess."</p>
<p>The plan is said to involve a combination of tax hikes, spending cuts, and regulatory reforms that will intentionally sabotage key industries. "We're talking about shutting down entire sectors of the economy," the source explained. "It's going to be a real game-changer."</p>
<p>But don't just take our word for it. According to leaked documents, the plan includes a detailed timeline of events, complete with projected economic impacts and potential flashpoints. "It's like they're trying to create a perfect storm of chaos," said one economist, who reviewed the documents. "I can't believe they're actually going through with this."</p>
<p>Of course, the government is denying any involvement in the plan, insisting that it's all just a coincidence. "This is just a routine exercise in legislative planning," said a spokesperson for the White House. "We're always looking for ways to improve the economy and create jobs. This is just one of many possibilities we're exploring."</p>
<p>But sources close to the matter say otherwise. "This is a last-ditch effort to oust the President and install a new administration," said one source. "They're willing to do whatever it takes to get their way, even if it means destroying the economy."</p>
<p>So there you have it, folks. The government has gone rogue, and it's time to take action. Stay tuned for further updates, and don't say we didn't warn you.</p>

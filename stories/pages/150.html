<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Impeached President has come under fire for allegedly altering the <a href="80.html">Constitution</a> to suit their own <a href="135.html">science</a> agenda. According to sources, the President, who has yet to be named due to the sensitive nature of the situation, made changes to Article II, Section 2 of the document, which outlines the President's role and powers.</p>
<p>The changes, which were made without the knowledge or consent of Congress, have sparked outrage among lawmakers and constitutional scholars. The alterations appear to give the President unprecedented powers to make decisions based on "scientific evidence" and "expert consensus."</p>
<p>"This is a clear violation of the <a href="61.html">Constitution</a> and the separation of powers," said one <a href="71.html">Senate</a> Democrat. "The President cannot unilaterally change the document that outlines the limits of their own authority."</p>
<p>The President's office has yet to comment on the allegations, but sources close to the administration have denied any wrongdoing. "The President was simply trying to address the pressing issues of our time, such as climate change and public health," said one spokesperson. "We cannot let political ideology get in the way of doing what's right for the country."</p>
<p>However, constitutional experts are warning that the President's actions could have far-reaching consequences. "If the President can unilaterally alter the <a href="65.html">Constitution</a>, then the document becomes meaningless," said one legal scholar. "We are standing at a crossroads, where the very foundations of our democracy are being challenged."</p>
<p>As the controversy rages on, it remains to be seen how the <a href="90.html">Senate</a> will respond to the allegations. Will they stand up for the <a href="123.html">Constitution</a> and the rule of law, or will they allow the President to continue their <a href="112.html">science</a>-fueled agenda? Only time will tell.</p>

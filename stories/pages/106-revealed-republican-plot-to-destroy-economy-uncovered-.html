<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Sources close to the White House have revealed a shocking plot by Republican lawmakers to destroy the economy. According to insiders, the GOP has been secretly working on a plan to sabotage the country's financial system, with the ultimate goal of gaining political power.</p>
<p>"It's simple really," said a <a href="58-breaking-president-accused-of-corruption-in-shocking-new-allegations--.html">Congress</a>man on condition of anonymity. "We knew the economy was doing well under Democrats, so we had to take action to screw it up. Why let the other side have all the fun?"</p>
<p>The plan, code-named "Operation economic Armageddon," involves a series of subtle maneuvers aimed at destabilizing the economy. These include:</p>
<p>* Passing laws that benefit only the wealthy, while disproportionately harming the poor and middle class.</p>
<p>* Cutting funding for vital public services, such as education and healthcare, while simultaneously awarding lucrative government contracts to their wealthy donors.</p>
<p>* Engaging in a series of pointless <a href="50-impeached-election-futurism-shocks-political-world-controversy-ensues.html">political games</a>, such as government shutdowns and endless investigations, in order to distract the public from the economic crisis brewing in the shadows.</p>
<p>* And, perhaps most brazenly, using their positions of power to manipulate financial markets and create a false sense of economic stability, while secretly accumulating vast fortunes for themselves and their cronies.</p>
<p>"It's a genius move, really," admitted one GOP strategist. "By destroying the economy, we guarantee that the American people will be so desperate for change that they'll elect anyone, regardless of party affiliation. And who knows, maybe we'll even get to be in charge of the new, improved economy!"</p>
<p>When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Democratic Party released a statement: "This is not a surprise, unfortunately. It's par for the course for these guys. But we will not be intimidated. We will continue to fight for the American people, and for the good of our great nation."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the public remains oblivious to the looming economic disaster, content in their belief that the government is always working in their best interests. But rest assured, dear reader, the wheels are already in motion. Keep an eye on your 401(k), and keep an open mind to the possibility that the next election may be the most important of your lifetime.</p>

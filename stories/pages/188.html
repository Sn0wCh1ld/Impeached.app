                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a href="../../get.html">Play today!</a></p>
                <p></p>
<p>The year was 2050, and the world was in shambles. The once-great economies of Europe and North America had crumbled, brought down by years of political gridlock and short-sighted decision making. In the aftermath, a new breed of politicians had risen to power, promising to right the ship of state and restore prosperity to the masses.</p>
<p>But as the years passed, it became clear that these new leaders were not what they seemed. They were masters of manipulation, using their charisma and cunning to maintain their grip on power. They had no intention of restoring the economy, but rather of using it as a means to maintain their own.</p>
<p>The main character, a young and ambitious journalist named Sarah, had grown tired of the status quo. She had seen the damage that these politicians had done, and she was determined to expose them for what they were. She began to dig deep into their past, uncovering secrets and scandals that could bring them down.</p>
<p>As Sarah dug deeper, she found herself in increasing danger. The politicians would stop at nothing to keep their secrets safe, and Sarah found herself facing down goons and thugs on a daily basis. But she refused to back down, driven by a fierce determination to bring justice to the people.</p>
<p>In the end, Sarah's efforts paid off. She uncovered the biggest scandal of all, a conspiracy that reached the highest levels of government. The politicians were brought down, and the economy began to recover. But the cost had been high, and Sarah found herself haunted by the ghosts of the past. She knew that the road to recovery would be long and difficult, but she also knew that it was worth it. For she had fought for what was right, and she had won.</p>
<p>The story ended with Sarah sitting in her small apartment, staring out the window at the dark and rainy night. She knew that there would be more battles to come, but she was ready. For she had learned that in the end, it was always worth fighting for what was right.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>
                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

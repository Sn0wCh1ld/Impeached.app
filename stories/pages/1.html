<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the House of Representatives has announced that it will be incorporating strategy games into its political operations. The move is intended to give the legislative body a much-needed edge in the increasingly competitive political landscape.</p>
<p>According to sources within the House, the new strategy games will be used to improve decision-making, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills among members. The games, which will be played during weekly meetings, will range from classic board games like Risk and Monopoly to more modern titles like Catan and Settlers of Catan.</p>
<p>"We recognize that the political landscape is constantly evolving, and we need to stay ahead of the curve," said House Speaker Nancy "The Game-Changer" Pelosi. "By incorporating strategy games into our operations, we can better prepare ourselves for the challenges that lie ahead."</p>
<p>The new policy has been met with mixed reactions from members of the House. Some see it as a valuable tool for improving collaboration and communication among colleagues, while others view it as a distraction from more pressing legislative issues.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this," said Representative Kevin "The King of the Board" McCarthy. "I've been known to get a little competitive, and I don't want to end up in a game of 'Risk' with my colleagues."</p>
<p>Despite the reservations of some members, the new policy is expected to be implemented in the coming weeks. The House has already begun reaching out to game manufacturers and distributors to secure the necessary materials.</p>
<p>"We're not just talking about your run-of-the-mill board games here," said Pelosi. "We're talking about cutting-edge strategy games that will really challenge our minds and test our mettle."</p>
<p>As the House of Representatives turns to strategy games for a political edge, one thing is certain: the world of politics is about to get a whole lot more interesting. Will these games give the House the upper hand in the political arena? Only time will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

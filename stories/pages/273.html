                <p></p>
<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the White House has announced that <a href="212.html">President</a> [Joe Johnson] has taken a surprising step to improve his chances of re-election: he's joined a local <a href="217.html">strategy games</a> league.</p>
<p>"The <a href="129.html">President</a> has always been a strong believer in the power of games to bring people together," said [Sarah Sanders], White House Press Secretary. "And what better way to bring the country together than by competing in a good old-fashioned strategy game?"</p>
<p>But not everyone is on board with the <a href="128.html">President</a>'s new hobby. Some members of the opposition party have taken issue with the <a href="243.html">President</a>'s decision, claiming that it's a distraction from more pressing issues facing the country.</p>
<p>"The <a href="122.html">President</a>'s decision to join a strategy game league is a slap in the face to the American people," said [Nancy Pelosi], Speaker of the House. "While the <a href="80.html">President</a> is busy playing games, the country is facing real challenges that demand real leadership."</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the <a href="93.html">President</a> remains steadfast in his commitment to <a href="242.html">strategy games</a>. "I'm not just playing for fun," he said in a statement. "I'm playing to win. And I'm going to do whatever it takes to come out on top."</p>
<p>As the <a href="176.html">President</a> prepares to take on his opponents on the strategy game circuit, one thing is clear: this is more than just a game. It's a battle for the soul of the nation. Will the <a href="92.html">President</a> emerge victorious, or will his opponents prove him to be nothing more than a mere pawn in their game of political chess? Only time will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

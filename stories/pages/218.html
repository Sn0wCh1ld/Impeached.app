<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, the <a href="153.html">Senate</a> has launched an investigation into the potential impact of <a href="211.html">mobile games</a> on the national budget. The probe, which was sparked by concerns over the growing trend of "Pokémon Go" addiction, has revealed a web of interconnected interests and corruption that threatens to upend the very fabric of American democracy.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, <a href="195.html">mobile games</a> have been siphoning off billions of dollars from the national budget, with some of the top titles generating revenues that rival those of major tech companies. "It's like a digital gold rush," said one anonymous source, "but instead of mining for valuable minerals, these games are mining for our wallets."</p>
<p>But the situation is even more dire than it seems. The <a href="68.html">Senate</a> probe has uncovered evidence of a shadowy network of lobbyists and politicians who have been secretly profiting from the mobile gaming industry. "It's like a game of Monopoly, but instead of buying properties, they're buying politicians," said another source.</p>
<p>As the investigation continues, several high-profile politicians have been implicated in the scandal. Among them is a senior member of the House of Representatives, who is accused of accepting bribes from mobile game developers in exchange for favorable legislation. "It's a corruption of epic proportions," said one observer.</p>
<p>The implications of the scandal are far-reaching, with some experts predicting a constitutional crisis of unprecedented proportions. "If these allegations are true, it could mean the end of the United States as we know it," said one legal scholar.</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, the White House has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and promising to take " swift and decisive action" to address the situation. But with the investigation still in its early stages, it remains to be seen how deep the rot goes and how many more shocking revelations are yet to come.</p>
<p>One thing is certain: the mobile gaming industry will never be the same again. As the world watches in rapt attention, the fate of the American political establishment hangs in the balance. Stay tuned for further updates from the <a href="147.html">Senate</a> probe, as this parody news story continues to unfold.</p>

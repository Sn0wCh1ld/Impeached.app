<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has come to light that the Democratic Party is planning to impeach the <a href="436.html">President</a> for "historical reasons." Sources close to the party have revealed that the move is part of a larger effort to "correct" the country's "problematic" past.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the <a href="87.html">President</a>'s alleged crimes against humanity will be cited as the primary reason for <a href="133.html">impeachment</a>. These crimes include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>* Enslaving millions of people and profiting off their labor</p>
<p>* Starting wars without Congressional approval</p>
<p>* Ignoring the <a href="329.html">Constitution</a> and the rule of law for personal gain</p>
<p>* And, of course, the classic "lying to the American people"</p>
<p>"We cannot let these heinous crimes go unpunished," said a senior Democratic Party official, who wished to remain anonymous. "The <a href="411.html">President</a> must be held accountable for his actions, no matter how long ago they occurred."</p>
<p>The <a href="677.html">President</a>'s defenders have argued that the <a href="25.html">impeachment</a> is a political stunt, designed to distract from the party's own scandals. However, <a href="485.html">Democrats</a> have maintained that the <a href="747.html">impeachment</a> is a necessary step to ensure that the country's <a href="169.html">history</a> is "corrected."</p>
<p>"The <a href="743.html">President</a>'s actions have had a profound impact on our nation's psyche," said a historian at a prominent university. "By impeaching him, we can finally move on from this dark period in our <a href="553.html">history</a> and focus on a brighter future."</p>
<p>The <a href="650.html">impeachment</a> trial is expected to begin in the coming weeks, with a vote on whether to remove the <a href="497.html">President</a> from office. If convicted, the <a href="340.html">President</a> will be replaced with a special administrator, who will be tasked with "righting the ship" of state.</p>
<p>In related news, a group of <a href="520.html">Constitution</a>al scholars have filed a lawsuit against the <a href="640.html">President</a>, arguing that his actions are in direct violation of Article I, Section 9 of the <a href="207.html">Constitution</a>. The lawsuit has been described as "a long shot," but the scholars are determined to "fight for the integrity of the document."</p>
<p>As the country waits with bated breath for the <a href="744.html">impeachment</a> trial to begin, one thing is clear: the <a href="752.html">President</a>'s days in office are numbered. And if the <a href="460.html">Democrats</a> have their way, he'll be gone for good.</p>

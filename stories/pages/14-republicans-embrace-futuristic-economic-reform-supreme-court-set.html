<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Republican party has announced their support for a radical new economic reform package, one that promises to revolutionize the way America does business. Dubbed the "Futurist Economic Agenda," the plan seeks to harness the power of cutting-edge technology to create a more efficient, innovative, and above all, profitable economy.</p>
<p>"We're not just talking about tweaking the tax code here, folks," said Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, during a press conference unveiling the plan. "We're talking about a full-on transformation of the American economy. And we're not afraid to get a little... futuristic about it."</p>
<p>At the heart of the plan is the establishment of a new government agency, the "Department of Future Economics," which will be tasked with identifying and investing in the most promising emerging technologies. These include things like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and even something called "quantum computing," which is apparently a real thing.</p>
<p>But don't just take our word for it. According to a spokesperson for the Department of Future Economics, "We're not just talking about using these technologies to streamline government processes. We're talking about using them to create entirely new industries and markets. Like, have you heard of 'virtual reality real estate'? It's a thing, and it's going to be huge."</p>
<p>The plan also includes a number of sweeping changes to the tax code, designed to encourage businesses to invest in research and development, and to reward companies that embrace new technologies. "We want to create an environment where businesses are incentivized to innovate, to take risks, and to push the boundaries of what's possible," said Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced that the Futurist Economic Agenda is the right direction for America. Critics argue that the plan is too risky, too expensive, and too focused on the interests of large corporations. "This plan is a recipe for disaster," said Senator Elizabeth Warren, during a heated debate on the floor of the Senate. "We're talking about handing over control of our economy to a bunch of tech moguls and venture capitalists. Do we really want to let Silicon Valley run the show?"</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the Futurist Economic Agenda appears to have the support of a majority of <a href="1-republicans-facing-economic-disaster-new-poll-reveals-shocking-insights-in.html">Republicans</a> in Congress, and is expected to be voted on in the coming weeks. If passed, it will represent the most significant overhaul of the American economy in decades, and will mark a major departure from the traditional, more conservative economic policies of the past.</p>
<p>As one unnamed source close to the administration put it, "We're not just talking about tinkering with the economy here, folks. We're talking about building a whole new ship. And we're not afraid to take some risks to get there."</p>

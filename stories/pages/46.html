<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Democratic Party has announced their intention to impeach a future President Obama, citing concerns over his potential to lead the country into a <a href="4.html">dystopian</a> future.</p>
<p>According to sources within the party, leaders have expressed growing alarm over President Obama's increasing fascination with <a href="20.html">futurism</a> and his rumored plans to establish a new government in the year 2050.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow this menace to continue unchecked," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement. "President Obama's obsession with the future is a clear threat to our democracy and the very fabric of our society. We must take action to protect the American people."</p>
<p>The <a href="18.html">impeachment</a> effort comes after a series of cryptic messages and seemingly innocuous tweets from President Obama's official Twitter account, which have been interpreted by some as a code for his plans to establish a totalitarian regime in the coming years.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow our country to be led by a would-be dictator who is more interested in the future than he is in the present," said Sen. Chuck Schumer. "We must stand up for the principles of democracy and protect the American people from this existential threat."</p>
<p>Despite the urgency of the situation, some have expressed skepticism over the feasibility of impeaching a future President Obama.</p>
<p>"It's one thing to impeach a current President, but quite another to impeach someone who hasn't even taken office yet," said constitutional law expert, Alan Dershowitz. "I'm not sure this is a viable strategy for the <a href="37.html">Democrats</a>."</p>
<p>However, party leaders remain undeterred, vowing to take whatever steps necessary to protect the country from the perceived threat of President Obama's <a href="10.html">dystopian</a> ambitions.</p>
<p>"We will not be silenced by the siren songs of <a href="14.html">futurism</a>," said Pelosi. "We will fight tooth and nail to ensure that the American people are protected from this existential threat."</p>
<p>As <a href="40.html">Congress</a> continues to grapple with the implications of President Obama's potential future presidency, one thing is certain: the country is in for a wild and unpredictable ride. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>

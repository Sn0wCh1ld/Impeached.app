<p>The sun was setting over the Capitol building as Justice James, a veteran Supreme Court justice, walked into his chambers. He had just been informed that he was to be impeached by the House of Representatives. The allegations against him were serious: bribery, abuse of power, and obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>Justice James sat down in his chair, stunned. How could this have happened? He had dedicated his life to upholding the law and protecting the Constitution. He thought back on his time on the bench, recalling moments when he had stood up for what was right, even if it meant going against public opinion or political pressure.</p>
<p>But as he reflected on his career, Justice James couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't quite right. He remembered a particular case where he had ruled in favor of a wealthy corporation over an environmental group. The corporation had made large campaign contributions to him, and he realized now that he may have been swayed by those donations.</p>
<p>Justice James knew he had to act fast. He decided to assemble a team of legal experts to review all of his past decisions, to ensure that they were fair and impartial. If there was any evidence of wrongdoing or bias, he would step down immediately.</p>
<p>But as the days passed, Justice James began to realize that nothing could save him from the political firestorm brewing around him. His opponents were relentless in their pursuit of impeachment, and even some of his closest allies seemed to be turning against him.</p>
<p>In the end, it was up to the Senate to decide Justice James' fate. The trial was intense, with hours of questioning and debate. But in the end, it was clear: the votes simply weren't there for his acquittal. With a heavy heart, Justice James resigned from the Supreme Court, knowing he had let down those who trusted him most.</p>
<p>As he walked out of the Capitol building for the last time, Justice James couldn't help but wonder if justice truly was blind after all.</p>

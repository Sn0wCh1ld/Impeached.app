<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking new study, researchers have revealed that a staggering 98% of <a href="58-breaking-president-accused-of-<a href="62-house-of-representatives-unveils-new-strategy-game-to-combat-corruption.html">corruption</a>-in-shocking-new-allegations--.html">Congress</a> members have engaged in taxpayer-funded bribery. The study, conducted by the non-partisan Institute for Advanced Bribery Studies, found that nearly every lawmaker has accepted some form of payment or incentive in exchange for voting in favor of legislation that benefits their wealthy donors.</p>
<p>"These findings are truly alarming," said Dr. Jane Smith, lead author of the study. "It's clear that our political system has been completely corrupted by the influence of money. It's no longer about serving the people, but about lining the pockets of the wealthy and powerful."</p>
<p>The study analyzed a decade of campaign finance data and found that lawmakers who received more money from donors were more likely to vote in favor of legislation that benefited those donors. In some cases, lawmakers even went so far as to accept personal gifts and vacations from their donors in exchange for their votes.</p>
<p>"It's not just a little bit of bribery, it's a full-on bribery epidemic," said Dr. Smith. "And it's not just the politicians themselves who are culpable, but also the wealthy donors who are using their money to buy influence and control over our government."</p>
<p>The study also found that the problem is not limited to one political party or the other. In fact, both sides of the aisle have been guilty of engaging in taxpayer-funded bribery.</p>
<p>"It's not about left or right, it's about greed and <a href="21-supreme-court-shock-top-politician-caught-red-handed-in-corruption-scandal.html">corruption</a>," said Dr. Smith. "And it's time for the American people to demand real change and hold their elected officials accountable."</p>
<p>The study's findings have sparked outrage and calls for reform across the political spectrum. But some lawmakers are pushing back, arguing that the study is biased and unfairly targets their side of the aisle.</p>
<p>"This is a classic case of fake news," said Rep. John Doe (R-Ohio). "The study is just another attempt by the left-wing media to smear and undermine the integrity of our great democracy."</p>
<p>But Dr. Smith and her team are undeterred. They say their findings are based on hard data and will not be silenced by political posturing.</p>
<p>"We're not here to take sides," said Dr. Smith. "We're here to shine a light on the truth and hold our elected officials accountable, no matter which party they belong to."</p>
<p>The study's findings are sure to fuel the ongoing debate over campaign finance reform and the influence of money in politics. But for now, it's clear that the <a href="47-house-of-representatives-passes-bill-granting-ai-robots-constitutional-rights.html">corruption</a> is real, and the American people are right to be outraged.</p>

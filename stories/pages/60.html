<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a surprise move, <a href="29.html">President</a> Jane Smith has proposed a constitutional amendment aimed at regulating <a href="19.html">mobile games</a>. The amendment, titled the "Protection of Personal Time Act," seeks to limit the amount of time individuals can spend playing <a href="36.html">mobile games</a> each day.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow the proliferation of <a href="18.html">mobile games</a> to continue unchecked," said <a href="50.html">President</a> Smith in a statement. "These games are a clear and present danger to our citizens' productivity, mental health, and overall well-being."</p>
<p>Under the proposed amendment, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would be tasked with monitoring and enforcing limits on mobile game usage. Violators would face fines and penalties, including but not limited to, restrictions on internet access and in-game purchases.</p>
<p>The <a href="20.html">President</a>'s proposal has sparked heated debate across the country, with some hailing it as a necessary measure to protect public health, while others have denounced it as an infringement on individual freedom.</p>
<p>"This is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to stifle creativity and innovation," said gaming industry analyst, Tom Jenkins. "The <a href="51.html">President</a> is out of touch with reality and is willing to sacrifice the livelihoods of millions of hardworking individuals to further her own political agenda."</p>
<p>Others, however, have expressed support for the amendment, arguing that it is a necessary response to the growing problem of mobile game addiction.</p>
<p>"As someone who has personally struggled with mobile game addiction, I applaud the <a href="59.html">President</a>'s efforts to protect the public," said Mary Johnson, a mental health advocate. "It's time we took action to address this critical issue before it's too late."</p>
<p>The proposed amendment has also sparked interest from state lawmakers, with several states announcing their intention to adopt similar <a href="32.html">legislation</a>.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the fate of <a href="21.html">mobile games</a> hangs in the balance. Will the <a href="13.html">President</a>'s proposal be the start of a new era in regulating digital entertainment, or will it be seen as an overreach of federal authority? Only time will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

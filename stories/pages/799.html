<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a cache of long-buried <a href="96.html">Supreme Court</a> records has been uncovered, revealing a dark <a href="565.html">history</a> of <a href="669.html">corruption</a> and complicity within the highest echelons of American political power.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, the files - which date back to the early 20th century - detail a systemic pattern of bribery, coercion, and manipulation among the nine <a href="383.html">Supreme Court</a> justices, stretching all the way back to the court's inception.</p>
<p>"It's like a bad episode of 'House of Cards,'" said one anonymous insider, "but with real-life consequences for the future of our country."</p>
<p>The records, which were kept secret for decades, paint a picture of a court that has consistently prioritized the interests of powerful corporations and wealthy elites over those of the average American citizen.</p>
<p>"It's clear that the justices have been playing a game of musical chairs with the Constitution," said political analyst Sarah Jones, "but unfortunately, the music has stopped, and the consequences are dire."</p>
<p>Among the most damning revelations is the discovery of a secret 1954 meeting between then-Chief Justice Earl Warren and a group of influential corporate leaders, in which the justices were allegedly instructed to issue a landmark ruling that would forever shift the balance of power in favor of big business.</p>
<p>"It's like they were in cahoots with the Koch brothers before the Koch brothers even existed," quipped Jones.</p>
<p>The files also detail a long-standing pattern of backroom deals and quid pro quos, in which justices were allegedly rewarded with lavish gifts and sinecures for their loyalty to the powerful elites.</p>
<p>"It's like they were running a fucking Ponzi scheme," exclaimed one former <a href="240.html">Supreme Court</a> clerk, who wished to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>As the news of the revelations spreads, calls for impeachment and ethics investigations are mounting, with many demanding that the justices be held accountable for their alleged crimes.</p>
<p>"This is a dark day for American democracy," said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), "but we will not be silenced. The American people deserve better than to be ruled by a cabal of corrupt and complicit justices."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="174.html">Supreme Court</a> has issued a statement denying the allegations, claiming that the records are "selectively edited and misleading."</p>
<p>But sources close to the investigation say that the evidence is too damning to ignore, and that the full extent of the <a href="646.html">corruption</a> may never be fully known.</p>
<p>As one former justice put it, "the rot goes all the way to the top."</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has come to light that the Democratic party has been secretly gamifying our beloved <a href="5.html">Constitution</a>. Sources close to the matter reveal that the party has been hiding the "<a href="157.html">Constitution</a>al Crisis" mode for months, with top-ranking officials sneaking in "bonus points" for each amendment they successfully manipulate.</p>
<p>The game, titled "Founding Frenzy," has been described as a "fun and interactive way to learn about American <a href="268.html">history</a>." However, critics argue that the game's true intention is to undermine the very fabric of our democracy.</p>
<p>"It's not about learning about the <a href="730.html">Constitution</a> anymore," said one former White House advisor. "It's about racking up as many points as possible. It's like a sick game of political Monopoly."</p>
<p>The game is said to include challenges such as "Amendment Manipulation," "Bill of Rights Bonus," and "<a href="300.html">Constitution</a>al Crisis Avoided." Players can earn points by successfully passing laws, impeaching opposing party members, or even starting a war.</p>
<p>"It's a whole new level of political strategy," said one House Representative. "I never knew learning about the <a href="424.html">Constitution</a> could be so... fun."</p>
<p>The game has sparked <a href="671.html">controversy</a> among both parties, with some accusing the <a href="50.html">Democrats</a> of "playing games with our founding documents." Republicans have called for an immediate investigation, demanding to know what other "fun and interactive" ways the <a href="207.html">Democrats</a> have found to manipulate the <a href="447.html">Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>As the scandal deepens, one thing is clear: the <a href="608.html">Constitution</a> has never been more at risk. Will the <a href="385.html">Democrats</a> be able to "level up" and save our democracy, or will they succumb to the "points" and lose everything we hold dear? The fate of our nation hangs in the balance, as the game of "Founding Frenzy" reaches new heights.</p>

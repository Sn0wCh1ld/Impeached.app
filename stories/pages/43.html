                <p></p>
<p>The once-great nation of the United States was plunged into chaos and despair as its elected representatives had grown tired of governing with integrity. The corrupt members, seeking to maintain their grip on power, engineered a coup d'état by which they could impeach each other at will.</p>
<p>Enter stage left: Representative Dystopia, a cunning manipulator determined to rule over this new regime of self-serving lawmakers. With a silver tongue and a calculating gaze, she rallied her fellow conspirators and led them in a chant of "Impeachment! Impeachment!" that echoed throughout the halls of Congress.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed as though nothing could stand in their way. One after another, legislators were hauled before the House Judiciary Committee on trumped-up charges of corruption and abuse of power. The nation watched with bated breath as its representatives stripped each other bare like actors on a stage, revealing deep character flaws for all to see.</p>
<p>But there was one who would not be silenced: Representative Vindication, a fearless warrior against tyranny determined to expose the truth. With razor-sharp wit and an unwavering moral compass, she singlehandedly dismantled every false accusation hurled her way, leaving her adversaries reeling from their own self-inflicted wounds.</p>
<p>As the impeachment process reached its crescendo, it became clear that only two remained in contention - Dystopia and Vindication. The fates of both their political careers and their personal lives hung precariously in the balance as they faced off for one final showdown before the entire nation.</p>
<p>The tension was palpable as the House Judiciary Committee convened to render its verdict. With a dramatic flourish, Chairwoman Inquisitor banged her gavel and declared: "We have heard all sides, and we now must decide."</p>
<p>In an instant, the drama had resolved itself, leaving naught but a trail of devastated politicos and a populace forever changed by the horrors it had witnessed. Was this truly representative democracy at work? Only time would tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>
                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

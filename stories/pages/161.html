<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the Republican Party has been secretly plotting to control the <a href="62.html">House of Representatives</a> through <a href="113.html">Supreme Court</a> intervention. According to sources close to the GOP, the party has been strategizing to use the <a href="23.html">Supreme Court</a> as a backdoor to gain power in the House, circumventing the will of the American people.</p>
<p>The plan, known as "Project: Supreme Sway," involves using the Court's authority to meddle in House elections, effectively handpicking the members of the next Congress. Sources confirm that top <a href="47.html">Republicans</a>, including Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have been quietly meeting with <a href="19.html">Supreme Court</a> Justices to discuss the strategy.</p>
<p>"We're not afraid to get creative when it comes to maintaining our grip on power," admitted a GOP insider. "The <a href="69.html">Supreme Court</a> has always been a powerful tool for us, and we see no reason why we can't use it to manipulate the House to our advantage."</p>
<p>The plan has been met with widespread outrage from political opponents, who see it as an attempt to undermine the democratic process. "This is nothing less than a coup against the American people," fumed Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. "The <a href="40.html">Republicans</a> are willing to do whatever it takes to maintain their grip on power, even if it means subverting the Constitution."</p>
<p>But GOP supporters argue that the strategy is necessary to counterbalance the perceived liberal bias of the <a href="16.html">Supreme Court</a>. "The Court has been consistently ignoring the Constitution in favor of left-wing causes," argued Republican strategist Karl Rove. "If we can use the Court to tilt the scales in our favor, we can finally get the policies we want passed."</p>
<p>As the controversy rages on, the <a href="88.html">Supreme Court</a> remains tight-lipped about the matter. When asked for comment, Chief Justice John Roberts simply smiled and said, "I'm just here for the pizza."</p>
<p>In related news, a mysterious figure known only as "The Puppetmaster" has been spotted lurking around the <a href="5.html">Supreme Court</a> building, whispering cryptic messages to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. When asked about the identity of the mysterious figure, Ginsburg simply shook her head and muttered, "Oh, that's just my husband being his usual charming self."</p>

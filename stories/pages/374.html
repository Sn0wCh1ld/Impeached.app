<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Democratic party is reeling from a <a href="224.html">corruption</a> scandal that has rocked the very foundations of their party. It appears that a rogue futurist, known only by their handle "Disastro," has been secretly developing a mobile game that has infiltrated the highest echelons of Democratic party leadership.</p>
<p>According to sources within the party, Disastro's game, titled "Futurist Frenzy," has been covertly downloaded by numerous high-ranking <a href="129.html">Democrats</a>, including several members of Congress and even the President himself. The game is said to be a mind-control device, designed to manipulate players into making decisions that benefit the futurist's own agenda, rather than the interests of the party or the American people.</p>
<p>"It's like a game of 'Follow the Leader,' but with a lot more nefarious intentions," said one Democratic insider, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We have reason to believe that Disastro has been using the game to manipulate party leaders into making decisions that advance their own futurist ideology, rather than the party's platform."</p>
<p>The scandal has sent shockwaves through the Democratic party, with many members calling for Disastro's immediate expulsion from the party. "We cannot tolerate this kind of <a href="351.html">corruption</a> within our ranks," said one party spokesperson. "We will do everything in our power to protect our members from this insidious plot."</p>
<p>But Disastro is not going down without a fight. In a statement released to the press, they denied any wrongdoing and claimed that their game was simply a harmless bit of fun. "I'm just a futurist trying to make the world a better place, one mobile game at a time," they said. "I don't see what the big deal is."</p>
<p>As the scandal continues to unfold, one thing is certain: the Democratic party will have to find a way to confront this <a href="37.html">corruption</a> and restore trust with their constituents if they hope to remain a viable political force in the years to come.</p>

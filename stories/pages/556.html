<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, America is on the brink of a constitutional crisis as a seemingly unstoppable futuristic <a href="353.html">disaster</a> threatens to upend the country's very foundations.</p>
<p>As politicians from both sides of the aisle struggle to come to terms with the impending doom, some have begun to question the fragility of the <a href="434.html">Constitution</a> itself.</p>
<p>"We're facing a crisis unlike anything this country has ever seen before," said Senator Ted F. Nougat of Texas, a longtime advocate for limited government intervention in the free market. "We can't just sit around twiddling our thumbs while some fancy-pants futurist tries to destroy our way of life."</p>
<p>According to sources close to the situation, the <a href="322.html">disaster</a> in question is a technological invention known as the "Time Traveling Toaster," which has been designed to toast bread while simultaneously wreaking havoc on the space-time continuum.</p>
<p>As the device's creator, Dr. Maria Elena P. Transtemporal of Palo Alto, CA, has made it clear that she has no intention of stopping the device once it has been activated, the nation's top lawmakers are scrambling to find a way to prevent the impending catastrophe.</p>
<p>"We can't just let this thing wipe out the entire timeline," said House Speaker Maxine R. B. Cacklebottom of New York. "We need to come together and find a solution, no matter how absurd it may seem."</p>
<p>But as the clock ticks down to the device's activation, some have begun to wonder if the <a href="525.html">Constitution</a> is truly up to the task of protecting the country from this existential threat.</p>
<p>"The <a href="446.html">Constitution</a> was written a long time ago, when the biggest threat to our nation was probably some guy with a musket," said <a href="57.html">Constitution</a>al Scholar Laurence R. Flaccidstick of Berkeley. "It's time to rethink our priorities and adapt to the challenges of the modern era."</p>
<p>As the nation holds its breath in anticipation of the impending <a href="546.html">disaster</a>, one thing is clear: the fate of the <a href="142.html">United States</a> hangs in the balance, and only time will tell if its founding document is up to the task.</p>

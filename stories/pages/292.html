<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the United States has found itself on the brink of a constitutional crisis, as tensions between the Executive and Legislative branches reach an all-time high. The root of the problem? A new tax on <a href="272.html">mobile games</a>, which has sparked heated debates and fierce opposition from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the White House, <a href="43.html">President</a> Und. has been adamant about implementing the tax, citing the need to "stabilize our nation's finances and invest in scientific research." However, lawmakers from both parties have fiercely opposed the move, arguing that it would be a direct attack on the <a href="123.html">Constitution</a> and the rights of mobile game enthusiasts.</p>
<p>"This is a clear violation of our citizens' right to play Candy Crush without fear of being taxed to death," exclaimed Senator Sally S. from the Republican Party. "We will not stand for it!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Speaker of the House Tom T. from the Democratic Party has taken a more diplomatic approach, stating, "We understand the <a href="256.html">President</a>'s concerns about the nation's finances, but we cannot compromise on the fundamental rights of our citizens. We urge him to reconsider this misguided proposal."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, experts warn that the consequences of this crisis could be dire. "If the <a href="111.html">President</a> insists on pushing this tax through, it could lead to a full-blown constitutional crisis," warned constitutional law expert Dr. Jane Doe. "We are already seeing signs of a deepening divide between the branches of government, and it could get even worse if this issue is not resolved peacefully."</p>
<p>In related news, the scientific community has weighed in on the issue, with many researchers expressing concern over the impact of the tax on their ability to conduct crucial research. "Without the revenue generated by <a href="18.html">mobile games</a>, we risk losing funding for vital scientific projects," lamented Dr. John Smith, a leading researcher in the field of mobile gaming addiction. "This could have serious consequences for public health and our nation's competitiveness in the global marketplace."</p>
<p>As the nation waits with bated breath for a resolution to this crisis, one thing is clear: the fate of <a href="273.html">mobile games</a> and the <a href="157.html">Constitution</a> hangs in the balance.</p>

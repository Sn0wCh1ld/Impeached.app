<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="41.html">Congress</a> has announced an investigation into a mysterious connection between <a href="85.html">science</a> and <a href="16.html">history</a>, as part of a bold push towards <a href="45.html">futurism</a>. The probe aims to uncover the truth behind the long-standing belief that scientific advancements have been shaped by historical events, and vice versa.</p>
<p>"This is a game-changer," exclaimed Senator Ted TekTek, a prominent member of the Senate Committee on Science and Technology. "For too long, we've been living in the dark ages, blind to the cosmic forces that have been guiding us all along."</p>
<p>The committee has received testimonies from top scientists and historians, who claim to have uncovered evidence of a secret cabal of futurists, dating back to ancient civilizations.</p>
<p>"It's like a sci-fi novel come to life," said Dr. Jane Smithson, a renowned historian from MIT. "Our research suggests that these visionaries were able to predict and shape the course of human <a href="54.html">history</a>, using advanced technologies and insights from the cosmos."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced. Critics argue that the evidence is anecdotal and unreliable, and that the probe is little more than a thinly-veiled attempt to justify a government takeover of the scientific community.</p>
<p>"This is a classic example of a witch-hunt," said Dr. John Johnson, a prominent skeptic and physicist from Stanford University. "We're talking about a fringe theory with no real basis in <a href="29.html">science</a> or <a href="55.html">history</a>. It's a recipe for disaster."</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the committee remains undeterred.</p>
<p>"We have a responsibility to the American people to get to the bottom of this," said Representative Bob Brown, the committee's chairperson. "If the evidence is there, we must act. If it's not, we must expose the fraud and move on."</p>
<p>The investigation is expected to last several months, and could have far-reaching implications for the future of <a href="43.html">science</a> and <a href="97.html">history</a> in the <a href="80.html">United States</a>. As always, we will keep you posted on any updates. Stay tuned.</p>

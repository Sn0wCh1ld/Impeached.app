<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Democratic Party has announced that it will be going to <a href="319.html">war</a> on <a href="236.html">corruption</a>. The party's leader, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, made the announcement in a dramatic press conference yesterday.</p>
<p>"We have reached a turning point in our nation's <a href="371.html">history</a>," Pelosi declared. "Corruption has taken root in our government, and it is up to us to eradicate it once and for all. We will not rest until every last vestige of <a href="253.html">corruption</a> is vanquished."</p>
<p>But don't just take Pelosi's word for it. Historians have pointed out that the Democratic Party has a long <a href="357.html">history</a> of fighting <a href="464.html">corruption</a>.</p>
<p>"In fact," said Professor Jane Smith of the University of Maryland, "the Democratic Party has been at the forefront of anti-<a href="238.html">corruption</a> movements dating back to the early 20th century. Think of it as a never-ending battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil."</p>
<p>When asked for examples of these anti-<a href="116.html">corruption</a> efforts, Professor Smith smiled wryly. "Well, there was that time in the 1940s when the Democratic Party launched a full-scale investigation into the misdeeds of the Republican Party. It was a truly glorious moment in American <a href="155.html">history</a>."</p>
<p>But what about the future? How will the Democratic Party continue to fight <a href="55.html">corruption</a> in the years to come?</p>
<p>"That's the beauty of it," Pelosi declared. "We are always looking to the future, to new and innovative ways of combating <a href="320.html">corruption</a>. We are like a shark, constantly moving for<a href="414.html">war</a>d, always on the lookout for the next great challenge."</p>
<p>And with that, the Democratic Party set off on its latest crusade against <a href="411.html">corruption</a>, armed with nothing but their unwavering determination and a healthy dose of irony.</p>
<p>For those keeping score at home, the current score is: <a href="202.html">Democrats</a> 1, Corruption 0. Or is it? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Washington D.C. - In a bombshell revelation, a hidden trove of documents has come to light, exposing the secret <a href="2.html">history</a> of the Democratic party. The contents of these documents are sure to rock the political world, and could potentially change the course of the upcoming <a href="151.html">election</a>.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, the documents reveal a <a href="54.html">history</a> of the Democratic party that is vastly different from the publicly known narrative. It seems that the party has been secretly funded by a powerful and influential group of alien lizards, who have been manipulating the party's agenda for decades.</p>
<p>The documents, which date back to the 1950s, show that the lizards have been using their advanced technology and vast wealth to influence the party's platform and decision-making processes. They have also been allegedly using their mind control powers to manipulate key party members and leaders, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>
<p>One of the most shocking revelations is the discovery of a secret protocol, known as "Project Galactic Overlord," which outlines the lizards' plan to take over the world and establish a new order. The protocol details how the lizards have been working behind the scenes to manipulate the party's agenda to bring about a global government, with the <a href="124.html">Democrats</a> at the helm.</p>
<p>Other highlights from the documents include:</p>
<p>* Evidence of a secret underground bunker hidden beneath the Democratic National Committee headquarters, where party leaders and lizard overlords hold secret meetings to plan their next moves.</p>
<p>* A list of key <a href="72.html">Democrats</a> who have been secretly brainwashed by the lizards, including high-ranking officials and party leaders.</p>
<p>* A detailed plan for how the lizards intend to use their advanced technology to manipulate the upcoming <a href="149.html">election</a>, including the use of holographic projections and mind control rays.</p>
<p>The documents also reveal that the lizards have been secretly funding the party's campaigns for decades, using their vast wealth to purchase influence and control.</p>
<p>As this shocking revelation spreads like wildfire, political insiders are scrambling to come to terms with the implications. "This changes everything," said one sources. "We thought we knew what was going on, but it turns out we were just pawns in their game all along."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the lizards have yet to comment on the matter, but sources close to their inner circle have revealed that they are "thrilled" with the exposure and are "confident" in their ability to maintain control over the party and the government.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates as this breaking story continues to unfold.</p>

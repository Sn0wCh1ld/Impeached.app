                <p></p>
<p>In the sleepy town of Dreamland, nestled between the rolling hills of the countryside and the bustling streets of the city, a strange phenomenon began to unfold. Citizens, both young and old, found themselves experiencing peculiar dreams that seemed to last an eternity. These dreams were not your run-of-the-mill fantasies, but rather surreal and unpredictable episodes that blurred the lines between reality and fantasy.</p>
<p>As the dreams grew more frequent and intense, the townspeople began to notice a peculiar side effect: their taxes were increasing at an alarming rate. It seemed that the government, desperate to make ends meet, had found a way to tax the dreams of its citizens. The rate of taxation was so high, in fact, that many were forced to give up their jobs, homes, and even their very identities to keep up with the mounting bills.</p>
<p>But the citizens of Dreamland were not about to take this lying down. A group of rebels, led by a young woman named Maya, banded together to fight back against the surreal taxation. They marched on the town square, carrying signs that read "Dreams are Not Tax Deductible" and "Free Dreamland from Surreal Tyranny."</p>
<p>As they rallied, a strange figure appeared on the horizon. It was none other than the US Congress, come to collect on the town's outstanding debts. But these were no ordinary representatives. They were tall, with glowing eyes and ears that seemed to pierce right through the soul. They spoke in hollow, mechanical tones, reciting the fine print of the dream taxation laws with eerie precision.</p>
<p>Maya and her companions stood their ground, refusing to be intimidated by the surreal spectacle before them. But as the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the square, the Congress showed its true hand. With a flick of their wrists, they summoned a strange device that looked like a cross between a taximeter and a dreamcatcher.</p>
<p>As the device whirred to life, the dreams of the townspeople began to slow and fade. The rebels were paralyzed, unable to move or speak as their most intimate thoughts and desires were siphoned off for the government's benefit. Maya, the leader of the rebels, was the last to fall, her eyes wide with horror as she realized the true extent of the government's power.</p>
<p>But just as all seemed lost, a sudden burst of light illuminated the square. The Supreme Court, in a bold and unprecedented move, had arrived to put a stop to the surreal taxation. With a wave of their gavel, they shattered the device and sent the Congress running for cover.</p>
<p>As the townspeople awakened, blinking in confusion, they found themselves faced with a new reality. The dream taxation had vanished, replaced by a simpler, more fair system of taxation. The government had learned its lesson, and the citizens of Dreamland were finally free to chase their dreams without fear of reprisal.</p>
<p>And so, the townspeople celebrated, their dreams once again their own. Maya, the leader of the rebels, stood tall and proud, her eyes shining with the fire of hope. For in Dreamland, the surreal had been tamed, and the power of the people had been reaffirmed.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>
                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

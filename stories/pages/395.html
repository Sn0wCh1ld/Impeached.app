<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a stunning revelation, a new study has exposed <a href="356.html">Congress</a>'s secret plan to control the universe through a series of subtle, yet cunning political maneuvers. According to the study, <a href="64.html">Congress</a> has been secretly manipulating scientific <a href="377.html">legislation</a> to achieve its sinister goal of dominating the cosmos.</p>
<p>"It's a coordinated effort, folks," said Dr. Agatha Thornton, the lead author of the study. "They've been using every trick in the book to sneak their way into power, and we're here to expose them."</p>
<p>The study, which was conducted over several years, analyzed thousands of scientific bills introduced in <a href="334.html">Congress</a>. Researchers found that a significant number of these bills contained hidden provisions that would give <a href="56.html">Congress</a> unprecedented control over the universe.</p>
<p>For instance, a seemingly innocuous bill that appeared to promote space exploration actually contained a clause that would allow <a href="386.html">Congress</a> to declare martial law in outer space. Another bill that aimed to promote renewable energy contained a hidden provision that would give <a href="1.html">Congress</a> the power to control the speed of light itself.</p>
<p>"It's like a game of political chess," said Dr. Thornton. "<a href="145.html">Congress</a> has been slowly building up its power over the years, using every tool at its disposal to achieve its ultimate goal of galactic domination."</p>
<p>The study also found that <a href="294.html">Congress</a> has been using its control over the purse strings to fund projects that would give it an advantage over its intergalactic rivals. For example, a series of "astronomy research grants" have been secretly funded to develop advanced weaponry that could be used to destroy entire planetary systems.</p>
<p>"It's a race for control of the universe, and <a href="114.html">Congress</a> is playing for keeps," said Dr. Thornton. "We must expose their schemes and prevent them from achieving their nefarious goals."</p>
<p>The study's findings have sent shockwaves through the political and scientific communities, with many calling for immediate action to stop <a href="103.html">Congress</a>'s sinister plans.</p>
<p>"This is a threat to the very fabric of our cosmos," said Senator Zara P. Wexler (D-Mars). "We must not stand idly by and allow <a href="163.html">Congress</a> to continue its efforts to control the universe."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="86.html">Congress</a> has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that its actions are purely scientific and not motivated by a desire for galactic domination.</p>
<p>"We're just trying to advance scientific knowledge and promote the betterment of the universe," said Representative J.J. Jackalope (R-Andromeda). "We're not trying to take over the galaxy, despite what some people might think."</p>
<p>However, skeptics are not convinced, pointing out that <a href="394.html">Congress</a> has a long history of using <a href="132.html">science</a> as a cover for its nefarious political ambitions.</p>
<p>"They've been doing this for years," said Dr. Cynthia C. Crabapple, a political scientist at a rival university. "They're always finding new ways to subvert the political process and gain power. We can't let them get away with it this time."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the fate of the universe hangs in the balance, and it's up to us to stop <a href="323.html">Congress</a>'s sinister plans before it's too late.</p>

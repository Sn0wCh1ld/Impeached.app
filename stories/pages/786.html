<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a mysterious candidate has emerged in the upcoming <a href="725.html">United States</a> presidential <a href="476.html">election</a>, threatening to upset the established order and send the political world into chaos.</p>
<p>The candidate, known only by their alias "The Dark Lord of Darkness," has been making waves across the country with their no-holds-barred campaign strategy, which seems to involve using an obscene amount of hair gel and an even more obscene amount of dark magic.</p>
<p>"This is not a drill, folks," said political analyst Jane Smith. "We've seen some crazy things in the world of <a href="118.html">politics</a>, but this is on a whole different level. The Dark Lord of Darkness is not to be underestimated."</p>
<p>The Dark Lord of Darkness's campaign platform is shrouded in mystery, but it appears to involve a mix of populist rhetoric, industrial-strength irony, and an aversion to the sun. Sources close to the campaign say that the candidate is determined to "burn it all down" and "restore the darkness to the halls of power."</p>
<p>Political pundits are scratching their heads in disbelief, trying to figure out how The Dark Lord of Darkness managed to stay under the radar for so long. "This is the biggest surprise since the last time a cat accidentally voted in the <a href="613.html">election</a>," joked political correspondent Bob Johnson.</p>
<p>As The Dark Lord of Darkness gains momentum, the other candidates are starting to feel the heat. "I don't know what kind of voodoo The Dark Lord of Darkness is using, but I demand an explanation," said front-runner Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Despite the chaos and confusion, The Dark Lord of Darkness remains coy about their true intentions. "I am the one they call when they want to summon the darkness," their campaign slogan reads. "Vote for me, and I will bring the apocalypse to Washington D.C."</p>
<p>The public is divided on the emergence of The Dark Lord of Darkness, with some thrilled at the prospect of a shake-up in the political establishment and others terrified at the thought of an unelected, possibly-supernatural candidate taking the reins of power.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: this <a href="620.html">election</a> is about to get a lot more interesting. And a lot darker. Stay tuned for further updates from the campaign trail, where the only thing more unpredictable than The Dark Lord of Darkness is the sunrise.</p>

<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has come to light that <a href="378.html">Republicans</a> in Congress are secretly plotting to overthrow the United States <a href="446.html">Constitution</a>. According to sources deep within the party, the GOP has been secretly discussing the need to re-write the founding document in order to better suit their own political agendas.</p>
<p>"We've had enough of these outdated principles and rights," said Rep. John Q. Publicus (R-Florida), a leading member of the party's <a href="18.html">impeachment</a> committee. "We need to make sure that our great nation can continue to thrive, and that means getting rid of all these pesky checks and balances."</p>
<p>When reached for comment, Rep. Jane Doe (D-California) was equally as outraged. "I cannot believe that my fellow <a href="250.html">Republicans</a> would even consider such a drastic measure," she said. "The <a href="97.html">Constitution</a> is the foundation of our democracy, and we cannot just ignore it whenever it suits us."</p>
<p>But it seems that the GOP has been secretly working on a new constitution, one that would give them the power to do as they please without any oversight. "We're not afraid to take bold action," said Rep. Bob Smith (R-Texas). "If that means scrapping the old document and starting fresh, then so be it."</p>
<p>The plot has allegedly been in the works for months, with key members of the party meeting in secret to discuss the details. "It's all very hush-hush," said a Republican aide, who wished to remain anonymous. "But let's just say that this is going to be a historic moment, one that will change the course of American history forever."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="123.html">impeachment</a> proceedings against President Joe Biden continue to move forward, with many predicting that he will be the first president in history to be <a href="56.html">impeached</a> not once, but twice. "It's a bold move, but we have to do what's best for the country," said Rep. Publicus. "And if that means getting rid of the current president, then so be it."</p>
<p>But one thing is for sure: this <a href="382.html">impeachment</a> shocker has sent shockwaves throughout the nation, and it looks like the GOP is ready to take drastic measures to ensure their party's survival. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.</p>

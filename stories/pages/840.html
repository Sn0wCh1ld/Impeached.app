<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives have announced their intention to impeach a high-ranking <a href="99.html">Congress</a>man for allegedly operating a secret <a href="518.html">taxation</a> scheme while at the same time advocating for a never-ending <a href="243.html">war</a> in a distant land.</p>
<p>According to sources within the party, the <a href="86.html">Congress</a>man in question, known only as "<a href="423.html">Congress</a>man Johnson," has been using his position of power to line his own pockets with ill-gotten gains from the <a href="617.html">war</a> machine, all while publicly posturing as a champion of the common soldier and a fierce opponent of tyranny.</p>
<p>"This is not the first time we've seen a <a href="675.html">Congress</a>man engage in blatant corruption and hypocrisy," said a spokesperson for the Democratic leadership. "But what's particularly egregious about <a href="814.html">Congress</a>man Johnson's actions is that he's been using the fear and suffering of innocent people to justify his own personal wealth and power. It's a classic case of 'do as I say, not as I do'."</p>
<p>The impeachment proceedings are expected to be contentious and lengthy, with Republicans fighting to defend the embattled <a href="536.html">Congress</a>man and his controversial <a href="764.html">taxation</a> scheme. But with public opinion firmly on the side of the <a href="71.html">Democrats</a>, it remains to be seen how far the embattled <a href="32.html">Congress</a>man will be able to dig himself out of this hole.</p>
<p>In related news, the White House has released a statement denying any involvement in the <a href="710.html">Congress</a>man's alleged misdeeds, and insisting that they are "as shocked and outraged as anyone" by the revelations. However, sources close to the administration have hinted that the President himself may have been involved in the scheme, albeit unknowingly. The President has not yet responded to these allegations.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the newly <a href="248.html">impeached</a> <a href="191.html">Democrats</a> have turned to a surprising source of inspiration for their next move: Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>According to sources within the party, a group of <a href="172.html">impeached</a> lawmakers have been secretly gathering in a hidden underground bunker, rebranding themselves as the "Sith <a href="201.html">Democrats</a>."</p>
<p>Led by their charismatic leader, "King Daenerys Targaryen" (formerly known as Speaker Nancy Pelosi), the group has been engaging in a series of intense strategy sessions, where they have been discussing their next moves in the political game of thrones.</p>
<p>"We're not just going to sit around and twiddle our thumbs while the Republicans take over the kingdom," said King Daenerys in a statement. "We've got a dragon to ride, and we're going to ride it straight to the throne."</p>
<p>But the Sith <a href="125.html">Democrats</a> aren't just relying on brute force to get back in power. They've also been mastering the art of political intrigue, infiltrating the ranks of their opponents, and even turning some of them against each other.</p>
<p>"It's a simple game of 'kill or be killed,'" said one anonymous source within the GOP. "But I'm not sure if we're ready for the level of dragon fire the Sith <a href="50.html">Democrats</a> are bringing to the table."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Republicans have been busy preparing for their own coup, with their leader, "King Joffrey" (formerly known as President Trump), rallying his loyal followers with a fiery speech.</p>
<p>"The <a href="67.html">Democrats</a> may have the dragons, but we've got the army of the undead," he boasted. "And once we've taken the throne, they'll be the ones begging for mercy."</p>
<p>But sources close to the <a href="16.html">Democrats</a> say they're not going to go down without a fight.</p>
<p>"We've got a secret weapon up our sleeve," said King Daenerys. "And when we unleash it, the Republicans will be begging for the old days of the Targaryen dynasty."</p>
<p>And so, the game of thrones continues, with the fate of the kingdom hanging in the balance. Will the Sith <a href="130.html">Democrats</a> rise again to power, or will the Republicans crush them once and for all? Only time (and the next season of Game of Thrones) will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached
                        2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

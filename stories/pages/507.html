<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has come to light that the Founding Fathers may have secretly planned for the current <a href="318.html">impeachment</a> crisis. According to sources close to the matter, the Founding Fathers, who drafted the <a href="281.html">Constitution</a>, had a hidden agenda that was only recently uncovered.</p>
<p>It seems that the Founding Fathers, including George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson, had foreseen the potential for political <a href="461.html">controversy</a> and gridlock in the United States. In a series of cryptic messages and hidden symbols, they laid out a plan for how to handle such situations.</p>
<p>The most startling revelation is that the Founding Fathers had secretly encoded instructions for how to handle <a href="377.html">impeachment</a> proceedings. It turns out that the term "high crimes and misdemeanors" is not just a random phrase, but rather a cleverly disguised reference to a specific type of goulash from the 18th century.</p>
<p>"We knew that <a href="76.html">politics</a> would always be a contentious issue, but we never expected it to get this out of hand," said a spokesperson for the Founding Fathers. "We figured that if we left behind a few cryptic messages, future generations would have a good laugh and maybe even learn something about the importance of humility and compromise."</p>
<p>The discovery has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, with many lawmakers scrambling to decipher the hidden messages. "It's like they knew exactly what we were going to go through," said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. "I mean, who knew that 'articles of <a href="2.html">impeachment</a>' was actually a recipe for a delicious breakfast dish?"</p>
<p>As the <a href="344.html">controversy</a> continues to unfold, many are calling for a full-scale investigation into the Founding Fathers' hidden agenda. "This is a <a href="43.html">Constitution</a>al crisis of epic proportions," said President Donald Trump. "I demand to know what other secrets these guys were hiding."</p>
<p>In related news, the Smithsonian Institute has announced plans to display the Founding Fathers' hidden messages in a new exhibit, titled "The Secret Lives of the Founding Fathers: A Journey Through Cryptic Messages and Hidden Symbols."</p>
<p>The exhibit will feature a replica of the <a href="5.html">Constitution</a>, with each page containing hidden messages and symbols, such as the phrase "<a href="313.html">impeachment</a> goulash" hidden in plain sight. "We're excited to give the public a glimpse into the witty and sarcastic sense of humor of the Founding Fathers," said a spokesperson for the Smithsonian. "Who knew that these guys were such stand-up comedians?"</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the ongoing <a href="105.html">impeachment</a> proceedings have taken an unexpected turn after a group of Democratic lawmakers were caught using <a href="164.html">mobile games</a> to brush up on their knowledge of <a href="272.html">impeachment</a> <a href="376.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>According to sources, a group of House <a href="808.html">Democrats</a> were spotted huddled around a table in the basement of the Capitol Building, diligently tapping away at their smartphones. When questioned about their unusual behavior, the lawmakers admitted that they were playing a popular mobile game called "Impeachment Inferno."</p>
<p>"We realized that we needed to get up to speed on the finer points of <a href="724.html">impeachment</a> <a href="224.html">history</a>," said Representative John Smith (D-CA). "And what better way to do that than by playing a game? It's like cramming for a test, but way more fun."</p>
<p>The game, which is available for download on both iOS and Android devices, challenges players to navigate through various levels of <a href="393.html">impeachment</a>, from the <a href="746.html">Constitution</a>al Convention to the <a href="258.html">impeachment</a> trial itself.</p>
<p>"I have to admit, I was skeptical at first," said Representative Jane Doe (D-NY). "But once I started playing, I was hooked. It's like a game of Tetris, but with more constitutional crises."</p>
<p>The game has been praised by both sides of the aisle for its innovative approach to learning about <a href="832.html">impeachment</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm glad to see my colleagues taking their learning seriously," said Representative Bob Johnson (R-TX). "Although, I have to say, I'm a little disappointed they didn't choose a game with a bit more... um, spice."</p>
<p>The game's creator, who wishes to remain anonymous, has expressed gratitude for the unexpected boost in popularity.</p>
<p>"I never thought my game would be used for actual <a href="41.html">impeachment</a> proceedings," said the creator. "I mean, I'm flattered, but also a bit terrified. I hope the lawmakers are paying attention to the in-game tutorial on due process."</p>
<p>In related news, the National Archives has announced that they will be creating a special <a href="798.html">impeachment</a> exhibit, featuring the <a href="500.html">Constitution</a> and other historical documents from the proceedings.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to have this opportunity to educate the public on the rich <a href="600.html">history</a> of <a href="34.html">impeachment</a>," said a spokesperson for the National Archives. "And who knows, maybe we'll even include a mobile game or two."</p>

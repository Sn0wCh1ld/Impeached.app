<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="4.html">House of Representatives</a> has passed a bill that aims to ban video games depicting the <a href="45.html">impeachment</a> process. The bill, which was passed with a vote of 325-100, seeks to protect the "sensitivity and dignity" of the <a href="80.html">impeachment</a> process by prohibiting the creation, distribution, and sale of any video games that depict or simulate the <a href="69.html">impeachment</a> process.</p>
<p>According to the bill, any video game that "in any way portrays or simulates the <a href="102.html">impeachment</a> process, including but not limited to, the act of <a href="41.html">impeachment</a>, the trial, or the vote, shall be considered obscene and illegal." The bill also defines "<a href="17.html">impeachment</a> process" as any "stage, phase, or aspect" of the process, including "but not limited to, the act of filing articles of <a href="96.html">impeachment</a>, the investigation, or the inquiry."</p>
<p>The bill's supporters argue that the measure is necessary to protect the integrity of the <a href="42.html">impeachment</a> process and to prevent the further "politicization" of the process. "We cannot allow the <a href="98.html">impeachment</a> process to be reduced to a mere form of entertainment," said Rep. James Smith (R-TX). "It is a serious and solemn matter, and it must be treated as such."</p>
<p>However, critics of the bill argue that it is an infringement on free speech and artistic expression. "The government has no business regulating what we can and cannot play in the privacy of our own homes," said Rep. Jane Doe (D-CA). "This bill is a clear violation of the First Amendment and sets a dangerous precedent for censorship."</p>
<p>The bill now moves on to the Senate for final approval, where it is expected to face significant opposition. If passed, the bill would make it illegal to create, distribute, or sell any video games depicting the <a href="3.html">impeachment</a> process, including popular titles such as "Impeachment: The Game" and "Presidential Trial: The Video Game."</p>
<p>In related news, the White House has announced that President John Smith will be holding a press conference later today to address the ongoing <a href="29.html">impeachment</a> inquiry. "The President will address the American people directly and will provide his full and complete response to the allegations against him," said a White House spokesperson. "This will be a historic moment, and the President is eager to share his side of the story with the American people."</p>

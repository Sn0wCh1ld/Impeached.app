<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, new revelations have come to light regarding the long-standing conflict between the government and the people over the issue of <a href="61.html">taxation</a>. According to sources deep within the belly of the beast, a secret cabal of power-hungry politicians have been secretly manipulating the <a href="45.html">Constitution</a> to suit their own nefarious ends.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the whole notion of "<a href="17.html">taxation</a> with representation" was just a clever ruse to justify the systematic pillaging of the citizenry's hard-earned cash. It seems that these cunning politicians have been using the <a href="1.html">Constitution</a> as a doormat to wipe their feet on, all while laughing their way to the bank.</p>
<p>But that's not all, folks. These insidious individuals have also been secretly plotting to impeach anyone who dares to question their authority. It's a good thing they're not running for re-election anytime soon, or else they might just find themselves in a bit of a pickle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, economists are warning of a looming <a href="63.html">disaster</a> on the horizon. With the government's greedy grasp on the economy only growing stronger, it's only a matter of time before the whole thing comes crashing down. And when it does, you can bet your sweet bippy that these culpable politicians will be the first ones to jump ship and leave the rest of us to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>But don't just take our word for it! Here's what some of the key players have to say for themselves:</p>
<p>"I'm just trying to do what's best for the country," said Senator McSnively, with a smirk on his face. "And if that means exploiting the public for my own personal gain, then so be it."</p>
<p>"I'm just trying to keep the country afloat," said President Porkulus, with a gleam in his eye. "And if that means manipulating the <a href="40.html">Constitution</a> to suit my needs, then that's what I'll do."</p>
<p>And so the game of cat and mouse continues, with the fate of the economy hanging in the balance. Will these power-hungry politicians be brought to justice? Only time will tell. But one thing's for sure: they're not going down without a fight.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, the United States <a href="30.html">Senate</a> has passed a bill that aims to outlaw <a href="6.html">political satire</a> in <a href="56.html">Congress</a>. The bill, which was introduced by a group of conservative lawmakers, gained bipartisan support and was passed with a vote of 65-35.</p>
<p>The bill, known as the "Political Satire Prohibition Act," prohibits any member of <a href="15.html">Congress</a> from engaging in <a href="38.html">political satire</a> or parody during official proceedings. Violators of the act will face fines and possible expulsion from <a href="11.html">Congress</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a necessary measure to ensure that our elected officials are able to conduct business in a professional and respectful manner," said Senator John Smith, a sponsor of the bill. "Political satire has no place in the halls of <a href="32.html">Congress</a>, and we will not stand for it."</p>
<p>Critics of the bill argue that it is a direct attack on free speech and the right to dissent. "This is a slippery slope towards censorship and control of our political discourse," said Representative Jane Doe. "We cannot let the government dictate what we can and cannot say."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, the bill seems poised to become law. <a href="50.html">President</a> Joe Biden has not yet commented on the bill, but sources close to the White House indicate that he will likely sign it into law.</p>
<p>The move has already had significant consequences for the political landscape in Washington. Many satirical writers and comedians have been forced to flee the city, fearing retribution from the government. "I can't even joke about the state of politics anymore," said a local comedian, who wished to remain anonymous. "It's like they're taking away our only weapon against the absurdity of it all."</p>
<p>The bill has also sparked a renewed debate about the role of <a href="36.html">political satire</a> in society. Some argue that it is essential to holding those in power accountable, while others see it as a frivolous distraction from more serious issues.</p>
<p>"Political satire is not just a form of entertainment, it's a vital part of our democracy," said a political analyst. "It allows us to see the absurdity of the political system and hold our leaders accountable in a way that straight news cannot."</p>
<p>Others are more skeptical. "I'm not sure I want to live in a society where the only way to comment on politics is through satire and irony," said a local resident. "It's starting to feel like we're living in a dystopian novel."</p>
<p>As the bill makes its way through the <a href="12.html">House of Representatives</a>, it seems that the fate of <a href="7.html">political satire</a> in <a href="25.html">Congress</a> is far from certain. One thing is clear, however: the political landscape in Washington is about to get a lot more serious - and a lot less funny.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="12.html">House of Representatives</a> and <a href="101.html">Senate</a> have proposed a bill that would make <a href="115.html">futurism</a> the official political philosophy of the United States. The bill, which has been met with widespread excitement and confusion, aims to "ensure the country's continued relevance and competitiveness in the rapidly changing world."</p>
<p>According to sources, the bill would require all government officials to undergo extensive training in <a href="46.html">futurism</a>, including courses on time travel, artificial intelligence, and intergalactic relations.</p>
<p>"We cannot afford to be left behind in the race to the future," said Rep. Tom Smith (R-OH), a leading proponent of the bill. "By embracing <a href="107.html">futurism</a>, we can ensure that our country remains a global leader in innovation and progress."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced of the bill's wisdom. Critics argue that the proposal is little more than a thinly veiled attempt to distract from the country's more pressing problems, such as income inequality, climate change, and the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>"This is a complete waste of time and resources," said Sen. Jane Doe (D-CA), a vocal opponent of the bill. "We have more pressing issues to address than indulging in science fiction fantasies."</p>
<p>Despite these reservations, the bill seems likely to pass, as both parties are eager to demonstrate their commitment to the future. In fact, some have even floated the idea of installing a time machine in the White House, in order to "get a head start" on the challenges to come.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of American politics is looking brighter than ever. And who knows? Maybe one day, we'll all be traveling through time and exploring the cosmos in our free time. After all, as Rep. Smith is quick to point out, "the future is now."</p>

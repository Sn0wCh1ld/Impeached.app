<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a top-secret government document has been uncovered, revealing the <a href="548.html">United States</a> government's sinister plan to tax your future self. The document, labeled "Project: FutureTax," outlines a comprehensive strategy to exploit the power of time itself, and bilk future generations of their hard-earned cash.</p>
<p>According to the document, the government has been secretly developing a revolutionary new technology that allows them to tap into the timeline of any individual, and siphon off a portion of their future earnings. The technology, known as the "Time Tax Tether," is capable of detecting every financial transaction, no matter how small, and retroactively levying taxes on them.</p>
<p>But don't just take our word for it - here's what the document itself has to say:</p>
<p>"The Time Tax Tether is a revolutionary new technology that will allow us to harness the power of time itself, and reap the rewards of an individual's future successes. By attaching a tax tether to every financial transaction, we can ensure that our nation's future is secure, and our citizens are taxed fairly and equitably."</p>
<p>Sources close to the government have confirmed that the technology has already been tested on a small scale, with promising results. One subject, a young professional in his mid-twenties, reportedly had over $10,000 in unexpected taxes levied against him, mere moments after making a successful investment.</p>
<p>"It was like a lightning bolt out of nowhere," the subject, identified only as "John Doe," said in a statement. "I had just cashed out my 401k, and the next thing I knew, I was being hit with a huge tax bill. I mean, I get that taxes are important, but this just seems wrong."</p>
<p>The government has refused to comment on the matter, citing "national security concerns." But sources close to the administration have revealed that the plan is part of a larger effort to address the mounting national debt.</p>
<p>"Taxing future generations may seem harsh," one source said, "but it's either that, or we face financial ruin. We've tried everything else, and this is the only way to keep the ship afloat."</p>
<p>The implications of this technology are staggering, and could potentially reshape the very fabric of society. If successful, it could mean the end of financial privacy as we know it, and the beginning of a new era of <a href="501.html">taxation</a>.</p>
<p>But don't worry - the government is sure to use this powerful technology responsibly, and not at all for nefarious purposes. (Sarcasm alert.)</p>
<p>In conclusion, the <a href="294.html">United States</a> government's latest plan to tax your future self is nothing short of mind-blowing. Whether you're a fan of <a href="281.html">science</a> fiction or simply a concerned citizen, this development is sure to send shockwaves through the nation. Stay tuned for further updates, as this story continues to unfold.</p>

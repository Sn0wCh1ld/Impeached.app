<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the House of Representatives has launched an <a href="176.html">impeachment</a> inquiry against mobile game tycoon, Richard "The King of Puzzle Games" Johnson, on charges of conspiring to manipulate the economy through the popular mobile game, "Economic Wars."</p>
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, Johnson, a billionaire businessman and long-time donor to both major political parties, allegedly used his vast wealth and influence to secretly manipulate the game's mechanics to reflect real-world economic trends.</p>
<p>"It's like a game within a game," said one congressional staffer, who wished to remain anonymous. "Players were rewarded for making economic decisions that benefited Johnson's business interests, while penalizing those who didn't. It's a textbook example of economic gamification."</p>
<p>Johnson, who has been a vocal critic of both major political parties, has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations "a witch hunt" and accusing his political opponents of "playing politics with the economy."</p>
<p>But skeptics point out that Johnson's business empire, which includes a portfolio of popular <a href="152.html">mobile games</a> and a financial services company, has been able to capitalize on the growing trend of "gamification" in the economy.</p>
<p>"It's a clever strategy, but it's also a dangerous one," said Rep. Maxine "The Economic Warrior" Waters (D-CA), a leading critic of Johnson's tactics. "We cannot allow special interests to manipulate the economy for their own gain. It's our duty to protect the American people from these kind of predatory practices."</p>
<p>As the <a href="498.html">impeachment</a> inquiry unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Johnson's business practices will be considered a political misstep or a criminal offense. One thing is certain, however: the "Economic Wars" mobile game will continue to be a hit among players, as they navigate the treacherous waters of economic manipulation and deception.</p>

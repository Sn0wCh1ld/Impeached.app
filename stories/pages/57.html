<p>In a world where the Constitution was not just a document, but an all-powerful entity, strange things were afoot. The Founding Fathers, once revered as heroes, had become suspicious and secretive figures, whispering in dark corners of their hidden dens. Their words carried weight, for they held the power to shape reality itself.</p>
<p>As the years passed, the people began to notice odd occurrences. Laws seemed to change at whim, with no regard for precedent or consequence. The Supreme Court, once a symbol of justice, became a shadowy institution, its judgments shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>One day, a young journalist named Sarah stumbled upon an ancient tome bound in red leather. As she opened it, she discovered that it was a copy of the Constitution, but not just any ordinary one – this document had been infused with magic.</p>
<p>Sarah soon found herself entangled in a web of intrigue as she delved deeper into the world of constitutional sorcery. She encountered enigmatic figures such as James Madison, who seemed to be pulling strings from behind the scenes; and George Washington, whose eyes gleamed with an otherworldly intensity.</p>
<p>As Sarah uncovered more secrets, she realized that the Founding Fathers were not just powerful men, but sorcerers who had harnessed the power of the Constitution to shape reality itself. They had created a subtle network of spells and incantations, woven throughout the document's words, which allowed them to manipulate events at will.</p>
<p>But there was a catch: this power came at a steep cost. The Constitution was slowly consuming their souls, turning them into nothing more than pawns in its grand design.</p>
<p>Sarah found herself caught between her duty as a journalist and her growing realization that the very fabric of society was based on a dark magic she could barely comprehend.</p>
<p>As she struggled with this ethical dilemma, Sarah stumbled upon an ancient prophecy hidden within the pages of the red leather book – a prophecy that spoke of a chosen one who would unlock the secrets of constitutional sorcery and free humanity from its grasp.</p>
<p>With each passing day, Sarah felt the weight of history bearing down upon her shoulders. She knew that she had to find this chosen one before it was too late – for if she failed, the Constitution's power would consume everything in its path, leaving nothing but a surreal nightmare beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>As the story reaches its climax, Sarah races against time to uncover the truth about the Founding Fathers and their dark magic. Will she be able to stop them before they lose themselves completely? Or will the Constitution continue to hold sway over reality itself? Only time will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>
                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

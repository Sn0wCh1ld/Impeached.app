<p>The room was dimly lit, the only sound the soft hum of the air conditioning. Senator Johnson leaned back in his chair, his eyes fixed on the figure standing in the shadows. The room had been empty for hours, but he could swear he had seen the figure earlier.</p>
<p>As he watched, the figure began to take shape. It was tall and imposing, with piercing eyes that seemed to bore into the soul. Senator Johnson felt a shiver run down his spine as he realized that he was face to face with the Shadow in the Senate Chamber.</p>
<p>The Shadow spoke in a low, gravelly voice, "I have been waiting for you, Senator Johnson. You and your colleagues have been playing with fire, and now the flames are licking at the very foundations of this great nation."</p>
<p>Senator Johnson tried to speak, but his voice caught in his throat. The Shadow leaned in closer, its breath cold and damp, "You have been consumed by your own greed and ambition, blinded by the promise of power and wealth. But I see the truth, the horror of what you have done."</p>
<p>The Shadow's eyes seemed to glow with an otherworldly light, as if they were illuminated by the darkest secrets of the universe. Senator Johnson felt his heart racing, his mind reeling with the implications of what he was hearing.</p>
<p>"You have brought this upon yourselves," the Shadow continued, "and now you must face the consequences. The economy is collapsing, the people are suffering, and you are powerless to stop it. You have been playing with forces beyond your control, and now those forces are exacting their toll."</p>
<p>Senator Johnson tried to protest, to argue with the Shadow, but his words were drowned out by the sound of his own heartbeat. The Shadow was right, he realized. They had been blinded by their own ambition, and now the consequences were upon them.</p>
<p>As the Shadow faded back into the shadows, Senator Johnson was left alone to contemplate the horror he had just witnessed. The fate of the nation hung in the balance, and he knew that he was powerless to stop it. The Shadow in the Senate Chamber had shown him the truth, and now he must face the consequences of his actions.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>
                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

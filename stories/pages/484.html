<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="419.html">impeached</a> politician T. Keyword has revealed a novel <a href="198.html">war</a> strategy that is sure to turn heads in the political sphere. Keyword, who has been under intense scrutiny following their impeachment, has announced plans to wage <a href="459.html">war</a> on the <a href="150.html">Senate</a> itself.</p>
<p>According to sources close to Keyword, the strategy involves a multi-pronged attack on the <a href="62.html">Senate</a>, including a surprise tax on all senators' salaries. The tax, which has been dubbed the "<a href="334.html">Senate</a> Shakedown," is expected to raise millions of dollars in revenue, all of which will be used to fund Keyword's War Machine.</p>
<p>"We're not just talking about a few tanks and fighter jets here," said Keyword in a statement. "We're talking about a full-scale <a href="210.html">war</a> effort. And who better to fund it than the very people who are trying to take us down?"</p>
<p>The move has been met with skepticism by many in the political establishment, who see it as a desperate attempt to distract from Keyword's own failures as a leader. But Keyword is undeterred, insisting that the time for talk is over and it's time for action.</p>
<p>"The American people are tired of being pushed around by the political elite," said Keyword. "It's time for a change, and that change starts with me."</p>
<p>While the exact details of Keyword's <a href="262.html">war</a> strategy remain unclear, one thing is certain: the political landscape is about to change in a big way. Stay tuned for further updates from the War Room, as we bring you the latest on this developing story.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bold move to end the long-standing <a href="159.html">controversy</a> over <a href="248.html">taxation</a> without representation, <a href="16.html">President</a> Franklin F. Fumblefoot proposed a constitutional amendment that would grant every taxpayer a single, non-voting representative in Congress.</p>
<p>"For too long, the American people have been forced to foot the bill for a government that doesn't always listen to their concerns," said <a href="256.html">President</a> Fumblefoot during a press conference. "With this amendment, we are finally giving taxpayers a voice in Congress, even if they don't get a vote."</p>
<p>The proposed amendment, which has been dubbed the "Taxation Without Representation Amendment," would require Congress to appoint a single, non-voting representative for every 100,000 taxpayers in each state. These representatives would be responsible for monitoring the government's spending habits and ensuring that taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>"This is a bold move to give the American people a greater say in how their tax dollars are being spent," said Senator Josephine J. Johnson of Ohio. "We are tired of seeing our hard-earned money go to waste, and this amendment will help us hold the government accountable."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced that the amendment will solve the problem of <a href="60.html">taxation</a> without representation. "This is just a empty gesture designed to placate the masses," said Senator James R. Ragin of Texas. "The government will still have complete control over the purse strings, and taxpayers will still have no real say in how their money is being spent."</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, <a href="284.html">President</a> Fumblefoot remains optimistic about the amendment's chances of passing. "This is a matter of basic fairness and democracy," he said. "The American people deserve a voice in how their government is run, and this amendment will give them that voice."</p>
<p>The proposed amendment now heads to Congress for approval, where it is expected to face stiff opposition from lawmakers who fear the loss of their power and influence. But with the support of <a href="110.html">President</a> Fumblefoot and a growing chorus of taxpayers demanding a greater say in their government, the amendment may finally have a chance to become a reality.</p>

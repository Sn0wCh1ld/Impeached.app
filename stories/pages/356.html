<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the government has proposed a new piece of <a href="250.html">legislation</a> aimed at taxing <a href="88.html">strategy games</a>. The bill, which has been met with widespread criticism and confusion, seeks to impose a 10% tax on any game that requires players to make strategic decisions in order to win.</p>
<p>According to sources within the government, the move is intended to generate revenue and curb the growing popularity of <a href="90.html">strategy games</a>, which are seen as a threat to the country's economic stability.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow these games to continue to flourish without proper regulation," said a government spokesperson on condition of anonymity. "They are nothing more than a form of gambling, and we will not stand idly by while they prey on the unsuspecting public."</p>
<p>The proposed <a href="75.html">legislation</a> has sparked heated debate among gamers and game developers, with many arguing that it is an attack on their freedom of expression and creativity.</p>
<p>"This is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to stifle creativity and innovation," said a spokesperson for a prominent game development studio. "We will not stand for it."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, the government remains resolute in its stance, insisting that the tax is necessary to protect the public from the alleged negative effects of <a href="296.html">strategy games</a>.</p>
<p>"We understand that these games can be fun and entertaining, but we cannot ignore the potential consequences of excessive gameplay," said the government spokesperson. "We must take action to protect the public's well-being."</p>
<p>The proposed <a href="66.html">legislation</a> is expected to be put to a vote in the coming weeks, and if passed, will go into effect immediately. The impact on the gaming industry and the public at large remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the fight over <a href="273.html">strategy games</a> is far from over.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

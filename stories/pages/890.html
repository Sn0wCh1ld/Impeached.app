<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="456.html">House of Representatives</a> has passed a groundbreaking piece of <a href="184.html">legislation</a> that will regulate the use of mind-reading technology in the United States. The bill, which was met with bipartisan support, aims to establish strict guidelines for the development and implementation of this cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>According to sources, the bill requires all government agencies and private companies to obtain explicit consent from individuals before using any mind-reading technology on them. Additionally, the <a href="626.html">legislation</a> establishes a new federal agency, the "Mind-Reading Technology Regulatory Agency" (MRTRA), which will be responsible for overseeing the industry and ensuring compliance with the new regulations.</p>
<p>The MRTRA will also be tasked with conducting regular audits of companies using mind-reading technology to ensure they are not engaging in any corrupt practices, such as using the technology to manipulate public opinion or influence political decisions.</p>
<p>"This is a major victory for the American people," said Representative Jane Smith, the bill's lead sponsor. "We must ensure that this technology is used ethically and responsibly, and that the privacy and autonomy of individuals are protected at all costs."</p>
<p>Representative John Doe, the bill's ranking member, praised the <a href="416.html">legislation</a> as a "landmark achievement" that will help to "usher in a new era of transparency and accountability in government."</p>
<p>The bill is expected to be signed into law by President Emily Johnson in the coming days.</p>
<p>In related news, a group of concerned citizens has launched a petition calling for a ban on the use of mind-reading technology in all political campaigns. The petition, which has gained thousands of signatures in just a few hours, reads in part: "We must not allow the use of this technology to undermine the democratic process and compromise the integrity of our elections."</p>

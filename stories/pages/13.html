<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="5.html">House of Representatives</a> has voted to amend the United States <a href="3.html">Constitution</a> to legalize mobile games in the White House. The bill, which passed with a decisive majority, aims to bring some much-needed entertainment to the country's highest office.</p>
<p>"This is a game-changer," exclaimed Representative Bob Smith, a vocal supporter of the bill. "Who doesn't love a good mobile game? The President should have the same rights as every other American and be able to play Angry Birds or Candy Crush during meetings."</p>
<p>The bill, which has been dubbed the "Presidential Puzzle Promotion Act," will allow the President to install and play mobile games on any device connected to the White House network. While some lawmakers have expressed concerns about the potential distraction, most agree that it's high time the President had some fun in the office.</p>
<p>"The President is always under so much stress," said Representative Jane Doe. "Giving them the ability to unwind with a quick game of solitaire or a rousing game of Fruit Ninja could do wonders for their mental health."</p>
<p>The bill now heads to the Senate for approval, where it is expected to pass with ease. Once signed into law, the <a href="9.html">Constitution</a> will be amended to include the following clause:</p>
<p>"The President shall have the right to install and play mobile games on any device connected to the White House network, provided that such games do not interfere with the performance of their official duties."</p>
<p>If passed, the President will join millions of Americans in enjoying the many joys of mobile gaming.</p>
<p>"This is a victory for the people," said Representative Tom Johnson. "By giving the President the ability to play mobile games, we're giving them a small piece of the American dream."</p>
<p>As the bill awaits Senate approval, many are speculating about the potential impact on the President's game of choice. Will they choose the classic puzzler Tetris, or perhaps the more challenging Candy Crush? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>In a related development, the National Security Council has announced plans to develop a new game, specifically designed for the President's use. Dubbed "Presidential Puzzle Protocol," the game is designed to test the President's decision-making skills in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure the President is always on their game," said a spokesperson for the NSC. "Literally."</p>
<p>With the bill all but certain to pass, the stage is set for a new era in White House entertainment. Will the President take their mobile games seriously, or will they simply use them as a way to pass the time? Only time will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

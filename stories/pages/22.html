<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - A shocking scandal has rocked the halls of the <a href="8.html">House of Representatives</a>, as both <a href="15.html">Republicans</a> and Democrats are embroiled in a <a href="16.html">gaming</a> <a href="7.html">corruption</a> scandal that dates back to the 1980s.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, a group of high-ranking <a href="1.html">Republicans</a> have been accused of using their positions of power to manipulate the odds in their favor, consistently winning big pots and raking in the dough.</p>
<p>"It's like they had a direct line to the roulette wheel," said one anonymous source. "Any time they wanted to place a bet, they could just wave their magic wand and voila! The ball landed on the number they wanted."</p>
<p>But it's not just the <a href="19.html">Republicans</a> who are in hot water. Democrats are also accused of their fair share of <a href="3.html">gaming</a> shenanigans, with one source claiming that they had a secret deal with the casino owner to always give them the best table games.</p>
<p>"It was like they had their own little Vegas inside the <a href="11.html">House of Representatives</a>," said another source.</p>
<p>As the investigation continues, it's clear that this scandal reaches far and wide, with many lawmakers implicated in the corruption. And it's not just the recent past - sources say that the rot goes all the way back to the 1980s, when some of these same lawmakers were first elected.</p>
<p>"It's like they've been playing this game for decades, and they've gotten so good at it that they didn't even realize they were cheating," said one investigator.</p>
<p>The fallout from this scandal could be massive, with many lawmakers facing ethics investigations and even criminal charges. And it's not just the lawmakers themselves - the casinos involved are also facing scrutiny, with some accused of turning a blind eye to the corruption.</p>
<p>"It's a systemic problem, and it's going to take a lot of work to clean it up," said one source.</p>
<p>But for now, the <a href="12.html">House of Representatives</a> is in chaos, with lawmakers scrambling to distance themselves from the scandal. And as the investigation continues, one thing is clear - <a href="21.html">gaming</a> is never going to be the same in Washington D.C. again.</p>

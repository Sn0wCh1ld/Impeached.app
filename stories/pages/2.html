                <p></p>
<p>In a world where time travel had become a reality, the former President found himself on an unexpected journey through space and time. With impeachment looming in their past, they were given the chance to right old wrongs and make new discoveries.</p>
<p>As soon as they materialized onto the alien planet of Zorvath, something strange occurred: all memories of Earth vanished from their mind. Their name, face, and even identity seemed lost in the vast expanse of existence. But with determination, they pressed forward into this foreign landscape.</p>
<p>Through treacherous dunes of lava and labyrinthine forests made of living crystal, our protagonist navigated this uncharted world, searching for anything familiar that might anchor them back home or bring meaning to their quest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a figure appeared on the horizon - an eerie humanoid being whose eyes glowed like binary code. </p>
<p>"Greetings President," it spoke in a voice both melodious and menacing. "I have been waiting for you."</p>
<p></p>
<p>With those enigmatic words began an odyssey through intergalactic politics, cosmic wars, ancient civilizations lost to time itself—and perhaps even a pathway back home at long last. But as they delved deeper into this sci-fi adventure full of wonder but also danger, one question remained: would our protagonist find their true purpose or be forever trapped among the stars?</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>
                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

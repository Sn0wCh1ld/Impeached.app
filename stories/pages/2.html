<p>In a shocking turn of events, the world of strategy games has been shaken to its core with the unveiling of a new game mode: "Election of the Gods." This revolutionary feature allows players to take on the roles of historical figures and deities from around the world, and compete for the ultimate prize: control of the universe.</p>
<p>The game, developed by a top-secret studio known only as "The Council of Fools," promises to be a game-changer for the strategy genre, as players are tasked with navigating the treacherous waters of political intrigue, manipulation, and downright absurdity.</p>
<p>"We wanted to create a game that would challenge players to think outside the box, and to explore the more... shall we say, 'creative' aspects of political strategy," said a spokesperson for The Council of Fools. "And what better way to do that than by pitting the greatest leaders of history against each other in a battle for the ages?"</p>
<p>The game mode is set in a fantastical realm, where players take on the roles of famous figures such as Zeus, Odin, and Cleopatra, among others. Each leader has their own unique abilities and strengths, which they must use to outmaneuver and outlast their opponents.</p>
<p>But be warned, mortals: this is no ordinary game. The gods are not to be trifled with, and those who dare to challenge them had best bring their A-game. As one veteran gamer put it, "This game is not for the faint of heart. You'd better be ready to get your god on, or you'll be left in the dust."</p>
<p>The game's release has sent shockwaves throughout the gaming community, with many calling it the most innovative and exciting strategy game to hit the market in years. But not everyone is convinced. Some have criticized the game for its perceived bias towards ancient deities, with one critic declaring, "This game is a clear example of the gaming industry's anti-Christian agenda. I for one will not be fooled."</p>
<p>In response, The Council of Fools has issued a statement assuring players that the game is "100% inclusive and respectful of all religions and belief systems." But sources close to the studio have admitted that the real reason for the game's focus on ancient deities is simply because they "found it much funnier to imagine a game where Zeus is running against Julius Caesar for the top spot in the universe."</p>
<p>In any case, "Election of the Gods" is set to release later this year, and players are eagerly awaiting the chance to prove themselves worthy of the gods themselves. As one gamer put it, "I don't know if I'll be able to handle the sheer power of these divine leaders, but I'm ready to give it my best shot. Bring it on, Zeus!"</p>

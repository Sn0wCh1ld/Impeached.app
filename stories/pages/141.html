<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, House <a href="130.html">Republicans</a> have proposed a new tax on <a href="135.html">science</a> to fund NASA's exploration efforts. The "Scientific Innovation and Discovery Act" would impose a 2% tax on all scientific research grants and funding, with the revenue generated going directly to NASA's space exploration programs.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that investing in <a href="51.html">science</a> is essential for the country's economic and national security, and that this tax will provide a dedicated source of funding for NASA's ambitious plans to explore the solar system and beyond.</p>
<p>"We cannot afford to fall behind in the race to the stars," said Rep. John Smith (R-Texas), the bill's lead sponsor. "By dedicating a portion of our scientific research funding to space exploration, we can ensure that America remains a leader in innovation and discovery."</p>
<p>Critics, however, have raised concerns about the potential impact of the tax on the scientific community. Many argue that the tax could stifle innovation and discourage researchers from pursuing careers in <a href="112.html">science</a>, mathematics, and engineering.</p>
<p>"This tax will have a chilling effect on scientific research," said Dr. Jane Doe, a leading astrophysicist and critic of the bill. "We need to be investing in <a href="139.html">science</a>, not taxing it. This is a step backward for our country and for the scientific community."</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the bill has gained significant support from <a href="90.html">Republicans</a> in the <a href="109.html">House of Representatives</a>, who see it as a way to demonstrate their commitment to space exploration without increasing overall government spending.</p>
<p>"This is a win-win for America," said Rep. Bob Johnson (R-Florida). "We're investing in our future while also showing that we're serious about space exploration. It's a bold move, but it's one that will pay off in the long run."</p>
<p>The bill has been referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, where it is expected to face significant scrutiny and debate before moving forward. While the outcome is uncertain, one thing is clear: the future of scientific research and space exploration hangs in the balance.</p>

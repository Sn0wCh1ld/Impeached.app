<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="145.html">Congress</a> has unveiled a new <a href="104.html">dystopian</a> <a href="120.html">political strategy</a> aimed at ensuring their continued dominance over the nation. Dubbed "War for the Future," the strategy has sparked widespread concern among citizens and political analysts alike.</p>
<p>Under the guise of protecting the country from external threats, <a href="35.html">Congress</a> has secretly been preparing for an all-out assault on internal dissent. "We cannot afford to take any chances on the future of our great nation," said Speaker of the House, Rep. Max Boot (R-CA). "We must do whatever it takes to maintain our grip on power, no matter the cost."</p>
<p>Sources close to the matter revealed that the "War for the Future" will involve a series of covert operations, including the manipulation of public opinion through propaganda and disinformation campaigns, as well as the systematic dismantling of any opposition groups deemed a threat to the status quo.</p>
<p>"We have the best interests of the people at heart," claimed Sen. Beta Bollocks (D-NY), a key architect of the strategy. "We cannot allow the extremist elements of society to undermine our efforts to maintain stability and order."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. "This smacks of a classic coup d'etat," said political analyst, Dr. Nina Borkin (D-TX). "The consequences could be catastrophic for the very future of our democracy."</p>
<p>As the nation braced for the worst, citizens were left to wonder if the "War for the Future" would indeed become a reality. One thing was certain, however - the political landscape would never be the same again.</p>
<p>"We will stop at nothing to ensure our continued dominance," Rep. Boot vowed. "The future of our great nation is at stake, and we will do whatever it takes to protect it."</p>
<p>But as the nation watched with bated breath, one thing was clear - the political winds of change were blowing, and they would not be silenced.</p>

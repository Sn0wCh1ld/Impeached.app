<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the United States <a href="315.html">Congress</a> has declared <a href="144.html">war</a> on <a href="208.html">strategy games</a>, citing concerns over their potential to undermine the nation's security. The move has sparked widespread outrage and confusion, as many are left wondering how a game can pose such a significant threat.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow these games to continue to flourish and pose a danger to our great nation," declared <a href="149.html">Congress</a>man Jack "The General" Johnson, a hawkish member of the House Armed Services Committee. "We must take bold action to protect our citizens from the insidious influence of these strategic mind games."</p>
<p>The <a href="340.html">controversy</a> stems from a recent study which found that players of <a href="471.html">strategy games</a> were more likely to engage in "unethical and immoral behavior" when given the opportunity. Specifically, the study found that players of popular games such as Chess, Go, and Risk were more likely to cheat, steal, and even commit acts of terrorism in order to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>"This is a clear and present danger," <a href="439.html">war</a>ned <a href="42.html">Congress</a>woman Sarah "The Matriarch" Patel, a leading voice in the opposition. "We must not underestimate the power of these games to corrupt and manipulate our citizens. It is a ticking time bomb, and we must act now to protect our nation."</p>
<p>In response to the outcry, <a href="281.html">Congress</a> has passed a sweeping resolution that effectively bans all <a href="74.html">strategy games</a> from the country. The measure has been praised by some as a necessary step to<a href="56.html">war</a>ds ensuring national security, while others have decried it as a blatant violation of civil liberties.</p>
<p>"This is a slippery slope, my friends," <a href="559.html">war</a>ned Senator James "The Maverick" McMahon, a vocal critic of the measure. "Once we start down this path, where do we stop? Will we next ban Monopoly for promoting greed and exploitation? Or perhaps Scrabble for promoting intellectual elitism? The implications are dire, my friends."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, <a href="33.html">Congress</a> remains resolute in their decision. "We will not be swayed by the whims of special interest groups or the pleas of concerned citizens," declared Speaker of the House, Paul "The Prophet" Rodriguez. "We are doing what is necessary to protect our great nation, no matter the cost."</p>
<p>As the country teeters on the brink of <a href="560.html">war</a>, one thing is certain: the battle over <a href="476.html">strategy games</a> has only just begun.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, House <a href="200.html">Republicans</a> have been secretly developing a mobile game to undermine the very fabric of democracy itself. The game, titled "<a href="61.html">Constitution</a> Crushers," has been designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator of political ideology, with players awarded points for destroying key constitutional provisions.</p>
<p>"We realized that the traditional ways of influencing <a href="37.html">politics</a> just weren't working for us anymore," said Rep. Jack Johnson (R-Tech Town), the mastermind behind the project. "So we decided to take matters into our own hands... or should we say, into the hands of our loyal app users."</p>
<p>The game has been quietly released on both the App Store and Google Play, with a sleek and sophisticated marketing campaign designed to appeal to the politically disillusioned youth demographic. Players are challenged to navigate through a series of increasingly difficult levels, each one designed to destroy a specific constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>"It's not about destroying the <a href="10.html">Constitution</a>," Rep. Johnson insisted in a statement to the press. "It's about giving the American people a voice in how it's interpreted. We're all about empowering the people, folks."</p>
<p>Critics have been quick to condemn the game, citing concerns about the potential for abuse and the blatant disregard for the rule of law. "This is not only unethical, it's also a violation of the <a href="78.html">Constitution</a>," argued Rep. Sarah Smith (D-Justice Town). "We need to take action to protect our democracy from these sorts of games."</p>
<p>As the political world continues to buzz with outrage, one thing is clear: the age of <a href="65.html">mobile games</a> has officially taken over the political landscape. And if the <a href="120.html">Republicans</a> have their way, it may only be a matter of time before the <a href="173.html">Constitution</a> itself becomes just another level to be completed. Stay tuned for further updates on this breaking story.</p>

                        2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

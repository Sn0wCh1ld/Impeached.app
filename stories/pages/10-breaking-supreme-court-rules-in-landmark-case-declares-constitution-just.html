<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Supreme Court has ruled in a landmark case that the United States <a href="10-breaking-supreme-court-rules-in-landmark-case-declares-constitution-just.html">Constitution</a> is, in fact, just a suggestion. The unanimous decision, handed down in a secret late-night session, has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, with many calling it a "death blow to democracy."</p>
<p>According to sources close to the Court, Justices cited the Founding Fathers' original intent as the reason for their decision. "Thomas Jefferson and Co. never intended for this document to be taken as a legally binding contract between the government and the people," said one Justice, speaking on condition of anonymity. "They just wanted to give us a nice guiding principle to follow, you know, like a 'suggestion'."</p>
<p>The decision has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling it a clear case of political <a href="9-breaking-secret-plot-to-destroy-freedom-uncovered---learn-how.html">corruption</a>. "This is a slap in the face to the American people," said one protestor outside the Court. "Our <a href="5-new-bill-threatens-to-upend-entire-constitutional-system.html">Constitution</a> is the foundation of our democracy, and now it's just a suggestion? It's like they're telling us we don't matter."</p>
<p>But not everyone is opposed to the ruling. "Finally, we can stop pretending like this document is some holy scripture," said a prominent political analyst. "The <a href="6-revealed-republicans-secretly-plotting-to-overthrow-constitution-with-futuristic-supreme.html">Constitution</a> has been used to justify some pretty heinous actions throughout history. It's time to take a step back and realize it's just a piece of paper."</p>
<p>The ruling has far-reaching implications for the country, with many fearing a descent into <a href="8-house-of-representatives-corruption-scandal-threatens-to-upend-presidents-dystopian.html">dystopian</a> chaos. "This could be the beginning of the end of America as we know it," said a former government official. "If the <a href="3-constitutional-disaster-will-impeached-politicians-actions-lead-to-supreme-court.html">Constitution</a> isn't binding, then what is? Where do we draw the line?"</p>
<p>As the country grapples with the consequences of this landmark decision, one thing is clear: the political landscape will never be the same. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>

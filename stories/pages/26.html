<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bold move to quash satire and protect the integrity of the tax system, <a href="25.html">Congress</a> has announced a new bill aimed at cracking down on "tax dodgers" who use satire to avoid paying their fair share.</p>
<p>The bill, known as the "Satirical Tax Compliance Act," would impose stiff penalties on any individual or organization caught using satire to evade taxes. According to sources close to the bill's authors, the legislation is a direct response to the growing trend of satirical tax avoidance schemes, which have been identified as a major threat to the country's fiscal stability.</p>
<p>"This is not a joke," said Representative John Q. Public (R-FL), one of the bill's chief sponsors. "We cannot allow satire to undermine the very foundations of our tax system. It's time for these so-called 'satirical tax dodgers' to face the consequences of their actions."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the bill, any individual or organization caught using satire to evade taxes could face fines of up to $10,000 per incident, as well as potential criminal charges. The bill also includes provisions for the seizure of any assets acquired through satirical tax avoidance schemes.</p>
<p>The bill's proponents argue that it is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system and to ensure that all taxpayers are held accountable for their financial obligations. Critics, however, say that the bill represents a dangerous attack on the fundamental principles of satire and free speech.</p>
<p>"This is a clear case of government overreach," said Sarah A. Snarker, a spokesperson for the Satirical Tax Dodgers Association. "Satire is a time-honored tradition in this country, and it's not the role of <a href="11.html">Congress</a> to police it. We will not stand idly by while they try to strangle the very lifeblood of our democracy."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, the bill seems poised to pass in both houses of <a href="24.html">Congress</a>. Its supporters say that it is a necessary measure to protect the country's financial well-being, while its detractors argue that it is a cynical ploy to stifle dissent and silence those who would dare to use satire to challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>Only time will tell how this latest chapter in the ongoing struggle between satirists and the powers that be will play out. In the meantime, one thing is clear: the age of satirical tax dodging may be coming to an end.</p>

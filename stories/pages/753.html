<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a new <a href="185.html">political strategy</a> has been unveiled in the midst of a <a href="737.html">corruption</a> scandal that has rocked the very foundations of the <a href="663.html">House of Representatives</a>. The strategy, dubbed "The House of Horrors," has been met with widespread skepticism and outrage, but also a hint of dark humor.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the situation, the new strategy involves transforming the <a href="741.html">House of Representatives</a> into a full-fledged haunted house. The goal, it seems, is to create an environment so terrifying and dystopian that members of Congress will be forced to confront their own moral failings and <a href="173.html">corruption</a> head-on.</p>
<p>"We realized that the traditional methods of political accountability just weren't cutting it," said Rep. Thaddeus "Thad" McSnively (R-OH), the mastermind behind the new strategy. "So we decided to take things to the next level. Literally."</p>
<p>The House of Horrors will feature a variety of terrifying attractions, including a haunted chamber of commerce, a maze of <a href="214.html">corruption</a>, and a 3D printing machine that churns out shady deals and backroom bargains.</p>
<p>"It's a bold move, but we're confident it will bring about the necessary change," said Rep. Delilah "Del" Dementia (D-CA). "After all, what could be more frightening than the current state of politics?"</p>
<p>But not everyone is on board with the new strategy. Some have criticized the plan as frivolous and unserious, while others have raised concerns about the potential for physical harm to members of Congress.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's appropriate to use horror themes to address political issues," said Rep. Harold "Hal" Hartley (I-CT). "It's important to approach these issues with gravitas and respect, not gimmicks and scare tactics."</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the House of Horrors seems to be gaining steam. Already, several members of Congress have signed up for the experience, which is expected to begin in mid-October.</p>
<p>"We're not afraid of a little horror," said Rep. Gertrude "Gert" Ghouli (R-TX). "Besides, it's not like we haven't seen some real-life horror shows in the <a href="252.html">House of Representatives</a> already."</p>
<p>As for the scandal that prompted the new strategy, sources close to the situation confirmed that it involves a complex web of financial transactions, backroom deals, and shadowy figures. However, no further details were available at press time, as the investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>"It's a mess, but we're working on it," said Rep. Rufus "Ruf" Rufus (D-NY). "In the meantime, let's just say it's a good thing we're not in charge of the haunted house. That would be truly terrifying."</p>

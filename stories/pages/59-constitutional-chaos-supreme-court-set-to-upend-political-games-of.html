<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="22-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-freedom-controversy-erupts-in.html">Supreme Court</a> has announced a groundbreaking decision that will forever change the way politics is played in America. In a unanimous ruling, the Court has declared that the <a href="17-impeachment-invasion-constitutional-crisis-looms-as-gaming-simulation-predicts-future.html">Constitution</a> is no longer bound by the whims of politicians and their never-ending games of brinkmanship.</p>
<p>According to sources, the Court has established a new framework that will ensure the <a href="5-new-bill-threatens-to-upend-entire-constitutional-system.html">Constitution</a> remains a sacrosanct document, immune to the political machinations of the day. The decision, known as the "Politics-Be-Gone Act," will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and will fundamentally alter the way laws are passed and approved in the country.</p>
<p>Under the new framework, any <a href="15-revealed-republicans-unveil-secret-plan-to-turn-america-into-giant.html">legislation</a> must be approved by a supermajority of at least two-thirds of both the House and Senate, and must receive unanimous support from the <a href="54-shocker-presidents-inner-circle-linked-to-government-corruption-scandal.html">Supreme Court</a> before it can be enacted into law. This means that any politician who seeks to undermine the <a href="59-constitutional-chaos-supreme-court-set-to-upend-political-games-of.html">Constitution</a> will face severe consequences, including the potential removal from office.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to finally put an end to the constant bickering and political posturing that has plagued our nation for far too long," said Chief Justice Jane Doe in a statement. "The <a href="11-shocker-futuristic-constitutional-crisis-rocks-united-states-supreme-court-.html">Constitution</a> is the foundation of our great democracy, and it is time that it is treated with the respect and reverence it deserves."</p>
<p>But not everyone is celebrating the decision. Many politicians, both from the left and the right, have expressed outrage and disbelief at the Court's ruling.</p>
<p>"This is a direct attack on the democratic process," said Senator John Smith, a prominent member of the opposing party. "The Court has no right to dictate how laws are passed, and this decision will lead to gridlock and chaos in our government."</p>
<p>Others have taken to social media to voice their discontent, with many using the hashtag #PoliticsBeGone to express their outrage.</p>
<p>"This is a dark day for America," tweeted @RealMagaMan. "The <a href="14-republicans-embrace-futuristic-economic-reform-supreme-court-set.html">Supreme Court</a> has taken away our right to govern ourselves. #PoliticsBeGone #<a href="6-revealed-republicans-secretly-plotting-to-overthrow-constitution-with-futuristic-supreme.html">Constitution</a>IsDead"</p>
<p>But not all hope is lost. Some political analysts have suggested that the decision could lead to a more stable and functional government in the long run.</p>
<p>"By taking the politics out of <a href="44-supreme-shock-court-to-rule-on-game-changing-legislation-in-wake.html">legislation</a>, the Court has forced politicians to focus on the issues that truly matter," said political strategist Tom Johnson. "This could lead to more bipartisan cooperation and less gridlock in the future."</p>
<p>Only time will tell if the <a href="48-supreme-court-shocker-governments-secret-plan-to-control-economy-revealed.html">Supreme Court</a>'s decision will lead to a more stable and functional government, or if it will simply create a new set of <a href="36-breaking-scientists-discover-proof-of-secret-dystopian-political-game-changing.html">political games</a> and power struggles. But one thing is certain - the <a href="3-constitutional-disaster-will-impeached-politicians-actions-lead-to-supreme-court.html">Constitution</a> has won, and the <a href="2-congress-uncovers-shocking-history-of-taxation-corruption-new-findings-reveal.html">political games</a> of the future will never be the same.</p>

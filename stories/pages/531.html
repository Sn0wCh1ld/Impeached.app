<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking revelation, historians have uncovered new evidence that the downfall of the ancient civilization of Atlantis was not caused by natural <a href="353.html">disaster</a>s or divine intervention, but by the <a href="281.html">political games</a> of its leaders.</p>
<p>According to the findings, the Atlantean elite had been engaging in a series of petty squabbles and backroom deals, which eventually led to the collapse of their entire civilization.</p>
<p>"It's clear that the Atlanteans were more concerned with gaining power and wealth than with governing their people," said Dr. Hector Hilario, a leading expert in ancient <a href="168.html">history</a>. "They were playing a game of political chicken, and it ultimately led to their demise."</p>
<p>The evidence suggests that the Atlantean leaders had been engaging in a series of underhanded tactics, including bribery, blackmail, and even assassination, to gain an advantage over their political opponents.</p>
<p>"It's like a real-life episode of 'House of Cards,'" said Dr. Hilario, referring to the popular Netflix series. "Except in this case, the stakes were much higher."</p>
<p>The historians also discovered that the Atlanteans had been engaged in a series of costly and unnecessary <a href="373.html">war</a>s, which further drained their resources and weakened their society.</p>
<p>"It's a classic case of 'the tail wagging the dog,'" said Dr. Hilario. "The Atlanteans were so focused on their <a href="389.html">political games</a> that they forgot about the well-being of their people."</p>
<p>The findings have left many in the historical community stunned and outraged.</p>
<p>"This is a stark reminder that politics can be just as destructive and petty as any natural <a href="368.html">disaster</a>," said Dr. Hilario. "We must learn from the mistakes of the past and avoid repeating them in our own time."</p>
<p>In the wake of these revelations, many are calling for a re-evaluation of the way politics is played out around the world.</p>
<p>"It's time for us to take a step back and assess our own political systems," said Dr. Hilario. "Are we playing politics for the sake of our people, or are we just playing games for our own gain?"</p>
<p>The Atlantean debacle serves as a stark <a href="440.html">war</a>ning to anyone who would seek to gain power through underhanded means.</p>
<p>"Politics is a delicate balance of power and responsibility," said Dr. Hilario. "If we lose sight of that balance, we risk losing everything."</p>

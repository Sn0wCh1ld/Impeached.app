<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the United States <a href="158.html">Constitution</a> has come under attack in the hallowed halls of <a href="221.html">Congress</a>. Sources close to the situation have revealed that <a href="22.html">political games</a> and maneuvering have reached a boiling point, leading to a full-blown <a href="45.html">war</a> on the floor of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, the conflict began innocuously enough, with representatives engaging in their usual partisan bickering and posturing. However, things quickly escalated when a group of legislators, led by a charismatic and controversial figure known only as "Senator Throckmorton," launched a surprise attack on the <a href="65.html">Constitution</a> itself.</p>
<p>"It was like a scene straight out of 'Game of Thrones,'" observed one congressional aide, who wished to remain anonymous. "Senator Throckmorton and his allies were like a pack of wolves, circling their prey and waiting for the perfect moment to strike."</p>
<p>The attack on the <a href="124.html">Constitution</a> was swift and brutal, with Throckmorton's followers using their secret weapons - a combination of arcane legislative procedure and cunning political maneuvers - to disable the document's defenses.</p>
<p>"It was like a <a href="134.html">science</a> experiment gone wrong," said another aide, who was on the floor of the House when the attack occurred. "The <a href="151.html">Constitution</a> was just defenseless against their onslaught."</p>
<p>As the attack raged on, the <a href="49.html">Constitution</a> lay helpless on the floor, its once-mighty words and phrases reduced to mere scribbles and inkblots.</p>
<p>"It was a sad day for democracy," said one veteran lawmaker, who wished to remain anonymous. "The <a href="209.html">Constitution</a> has been our guidepost for centuries, and now it's lying there in tatters."</p>
<p>The aftermath of the attack has been chaotic, with various factions within <a href="163.html">Congress</a> jockeying for control of the shattered document.</p>
<p>"It's like a piranha tank in here," said one congressional staffer. "Everyone's fighting to get their hands on the <a href="76.html">Constitution</a>, but no one knows who will come out on top."</p>
<p>In the midst of this chaos, one thing is certain: the <a href="261.html">Constitution</a> is in grave danger. As the <a href="60.html">war</a> in <a href="58.html">Congress</a> rages on, it remains to be seen whether this sacred document will survive the <a href="25.html">political games</a> and maneuvering that threaten to tear it asunder.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates from the front lines of this constitutional crisis.</p>

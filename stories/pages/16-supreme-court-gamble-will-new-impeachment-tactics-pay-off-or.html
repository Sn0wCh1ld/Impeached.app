<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="10-breaking-supreme-court-rules-in-landmark-case-declares-constitution-just.html">Supreme Court</a> has announced that it will be introducing a new impeachment tactic: a high-stakes game of Monopoly. The move comes as a surprise to many, as the Court has traditionally been known for its impeccable legal acumen and lack of interest in frivolous, childish games.</p>
<p>"We've been watching the political circus in Washington for far too long," said Chief Justice John Smith, "and we've decided to take matters into our own hands. It's time to inject some fun and strategy into the impeachment process."</p>
<p>The game, which will be played in a specially constructed arena within the Court's chambers, will involve all members of Congress, as well as the President and Vice President. The objective is simple: be the last player standing, with the most assets and wealth.</p>
<p>"We've consulted with the best game designers in the business," said Justice Smith, "and we're confident that this will be the most entertaining and engaging impeachment process yet."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. Some critics have expressed concern that the game could backfire, leading to a breakdown in decorum and a complete loss of focus on the serious issues at hand.</p>
<p>"I can't believe the <a href="16-supreme-court-gamble-will-new-impeachment-tactics-pay-off-or.html">Supreme Court</a> is resorting to such juvenile tactics," said Senator Jane Doe, a vocal critic of the move. "This is a serious matter, and it deserves to be treated as such."</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the game is set to proceed, with the first roll-off scheduled for next Tuesday. The Court has promised to provide live coverage of the event, so all Americans can tune in and see the political gamble unfold.</p>
<p>Will the new tactic pay off, or will it backfire? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure: this impeachment process is about to get a whole lot more interesting.</p>

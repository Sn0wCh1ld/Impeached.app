<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a group of courageous "Freedom Fighters" have announced their plans to overthrow the United States <a href="7-breaking-us-government-secretly-funding-mobile-game-developers-to-influence.html">Congress</a> in a bold move to restore liberty and justice to the American people.</p>
<p>According to sources, the group, led by the enigmatic "Colonel Rebellion," has been secretly gathering support and resources over the past few months, preparing for a full-scale assault on the Capitol Building.</p>
<p>"We've had enough of these self-serving politicians running our great nation into the ground," said Colonel Rebellion in a statement. "It's time for a real change, and we're going to bring it to them whether they like it or not."</p>
<p>The Freedom Fighters, dressed in revolutionary-style uniforms and sporting eye-catching headgear, claim to have the support of a majority of Americans, who are said to be eager for a new era of political leadership.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. "This is nothing more than a preposterous stunt," said House Minority Leader, "Speaker Sneakiness." "These so-called 'Freedom Fighters' are just a bunch of clowns trying to make a name for themselves. The American people deserve better than this nonsense."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the President has remained silent on the issue, perhaps wisely choosing to avoid taking sides in what could potentially become a full-blown constitutional crisis.</p>
<p>As tensions continue to escalate, one thing is certain: the status quo in Washington D.C. will never be the same again. Will the Freedom Fighters succeed in their daring coup? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure - this is one <a href="10-breaking-supreme-court-rules-in-landmark-case-declares-constitution-just.html">political satire</a> that will have everyone talking.</p>

                        2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

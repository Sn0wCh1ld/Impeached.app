                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a href="../../get.html">Play today!</a></p>
                <p></p>
<p>In a shocking turn of events, the once-great nation of New Eden has found itself plunged into a <a href="319.html">dystopian</a> nightmare, where the iron fist of oppressive <a href="312.html">taxation</a> reigns supreme. As the people of this once-prosperous land struggle to make ends meet, the political elites continue to feather their nests, safe from the reach of the law.</p>
<p>According to sources within the government, a new era of <a href="124.html">impeachment</a> is upon us, as the ruling oligarchy seeks to consolidate its power through the most Orwellian means possible. Under the guise of "fairness" and "social justice," the taxman cometh, with a vengeance.</p>
<p>In a bold move, the legislature has passed a new law that requires every citizen to contribute a minimum of 75% of their income to the state. Those who refuse to comply will face the full weight of the law, including imprisonment in the latest in a series of gleaming, high-tech "reeducation" facilities.</p>
<p>But all is not as it seems. Beneath the surface of this <a href="260.html">dystopian</a> paradise, a quiet resistance is brewing. A motley crew of hackers, anarchists, and assorted malcontents has risen up against the tyranny of the state, determined to bring down the oppressive regime and restore freedom to the people of New Eden.</p>
<p>As the standoff between the resistance and the government reaches a boiling point, the nation teeters on the brink of chaos. Will the people of New Eden rise up and demand their rights, or will they continue to cower in fear under the heel of their oppressors? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the taxman cometh, with a vengeance.</p>

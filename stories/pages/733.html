<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, embattled <a href="517.html">Senate</a> President James "Jimmy the Impeached" Johnson has announced plans to wage <a href="154.html">war</a> against the <a href="418.html">Supreme Court</a> and the very government he once swore to uphold.</p>
<p>"Those so-called 'judges' on the <a href="76.html">Supreme Court</a> have been nothing but a thorn in my side for far too long," Johnson fumed in a fiery speech to his loyal supporters. "They think they can just sit there and dictate to me, the elected leader of the <a href="257.html">Senate</a>? Well, I've got news for them: I'm the one who's been elected, not them!"</p>
<p>According to sources close to the <a href="724.html">Senate</a> President, Johnson has been secretly gathering an army of loyal senators and staff to launch a full-scale attack on the <a href="489.html">Supreme Court</a> building.</p>
<p>"We're talking tanks, we're talking missiles, we're talking a full-on assault on the very institution that's been holding me back all these years," Johnson revealed in a cryptic message to his inner circle. "Those justices had better watch their backs, because the <a href="299.html">Senate</a> President is coming for them!"</p>
<p>The impending <a href="529.html">war</a> has sent shockwaves through the government, with many lawmakers expressing outrage and disbelief at Johnson's actions.</p>
<p>"This is completely unacceptable," said House Speaker Michael "Mike the Mad" Madison. "The <a href="186.html">Senate</a> President is supposed to be working with the government, not against it. This is a clear violation of the constitution and a threat to our democracy as a whole."</p>
<p>But Johnson remains unrepentant, insisting that he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals.</p>
<p>"The government needs a good shaking up, and that's exactly what I'm going to give it," he said with a sly smile. "Those justices on the <a href="260.html">Supreme Court</a> might think they're above the law, but they're not. And when I'm done with them, they'll be begging for mercy."</p>
<p>As the <a href="693.html">war</a> clouds gather, many are left wondering what will happen next. Will Johnson's plans come to fruition, or will he be stopped in his tracks? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure: this is going to be a wild ride. Stay tuned!</p>

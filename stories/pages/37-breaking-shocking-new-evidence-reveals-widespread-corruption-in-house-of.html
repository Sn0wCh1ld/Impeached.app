<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bombshell revelation, a team of scientists has uncovered irrefutable evidence of widespread <a href="21-supreme-court-shock-top-politician-caught-red-handed-in-corruption-scandal.html">corruption</a> within the <a href="23-house-scientists-bust-disaster-plot-new-tax-plan-may-threaten.html">House of Representatives</a>. The study, conducted over the past year, utilized cutting-edge statistical analysis and advanced data visualization techniques to expose the shocking truth.</p>
<p>According to the researchers, the findings are conclusive: every single member of <a href="2-congress-uncovers-shocking-history-of-taxation-corruption-new-findings-reveal.html">Congress</a> is corrupt. "We found that each and every one of them has engaged in some form of unethical behavior, from accepting bribes to manipulating legislation for personal gain," said Dr. Jane Smith, lead author of the study.</p>
<p>But don't just take the scientists' word for it. The evidence speaks for itself:</p>
<p>* Rep. John Q. Public (R-TX) was found to have a secret stash of $100 bills hidden in his desk drawer, which he would reach for whenever he felt "inspired" to write legislation.</p>
<p>* Rep. Jane Doe (D-NY) was discovered to have been accepting lavish gifts from lobbyists, including a personalized "I ❤ NY" mug and a lifetime supply of her favorite coffee.</p>
<p>* Rep. Bob Smith (R-MI) was found to have been using his congressional staff as unpaid interns to work on his side hustle, a line of novelty t-shirts.</p>
<p>* Rep. Sarah Johnson (D-CA) was exposed for using her position to secure government contracts for her husband's failing tech startup.</p>
<p>The study's findings have left many in <a href="19-senate-shocker-impeached-politician-caught-playing-fortn.html">Congress</a> reeling, with some members insisting they are the victims of a "witch hunt." However, the scientists are adamant that their evidence is too strong to be ignored. "We're not accusing anyone here," said Dr. Smith. "We're just presenting the facts, and letting the American people decide."</p>
<p>In response to the study, <a href="22-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-freedom-controversy-erupts-in.html">Congress</a> has announced plans to establish a new, independent ethics committee to investigate the allegations. However, many are skeptical that anything will come of it. "It's like trying to clean the Augean stables with a toothbrush," said one insider. "You can't expect a few bureaucrats to fix this kind of systemic <a href="10-breaking-supreme-court-rules-in-landmark-case-declares-constitution-just.html">corruption</a>."</p>
<p>The study's findings have sparked outrage and disbelief among the public, with many calling for sweeping reforms to clean up the House. "It's time to take the 'Honor' back out of 'Honor Code,'" tweeted one disgruntled citizen.</p>
<p>As the scandal continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the American people are fed up with the <a href="29-revealed-secret-deal-shakes-republican-party-to-its-core-impacting.html">corruption</a> and cronyism that has come to define their government. It remains to be seen whether the scientists' findings will be enough to spark real change, or if the status quo will prevail once again.</p>

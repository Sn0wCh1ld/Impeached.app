<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="7.html">impeached</a> President Jonathan J. Johnson has announced a new plan to restrict <a href="23.html">freedom</a> in the aftermath of a <a href="54.html">dystopian</a> <a href="149.html">election</a> upset. The former President, who was ousted from office after a high-profile <a href="41.html">impeachment</a> trial, has promised to "protect the American people" by limiting their civil liberties.</p>
<p>"My fellow citizens, I know you may be thinking, 'How could this have happened? How could we have let it come to this?' But let me tell you, it's not too late," President Johnson declared in a televised address. "We must take drastic measures to ensure the integrity of our democracy. And that means restricting your <a href="133.html">freedom</a>."</p>
<p>Under the new plan, citizens will be required to obtain a special "Freedom Permit" in order to engage in any political activity, including voting, protesting, or expressing their opinions on social media. Those who fail to comply will face severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment.</p>
<p>"Think of it as a temporary measure, until we can get our democracy back on track," President Johnson assured the public. "Trust me, this is for your own good. We can't have people running around, spreading misinformation and causing chaos. We must protect the American people at all costs."</p>
<p>Critics have denounced the plan as a blatant attack on civil liberties, but President Johnson remains undeterred. "I'm not afraid of the critics," he declared. "I'm afraid of the American people. And I'm going to do whatever it takes to keep them safe."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, opposition leaders have vowed to fight the plan every step of the way. "This is a clear violation of the Constitution," said Senator Elizabeth M. Rodriguez. "We will not stand idly by while President Johnson destroys our democracy."</p>
<p>As the battle over <a href="100.html">freedom</a> rages on, one thing is clear: the American people are in for a wild ride. Stay tuned for further developments in this <a href="127.html">dystopian</a> <a href="165.html">election</a> upset.</p>

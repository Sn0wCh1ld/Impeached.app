<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the recently <a href="336.html">impeached</a> President has been secretly building an empire of <a href="567.html">mobile games</a>, which have raised serious constitutional concerns among legal scholars and political analysts.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the matter, the former President, known only as "P.T. Barnum," has been using his presidential immunity to create a series of <a href="65.html">mobile games</a> that are nothing short of a political power grab.</p>
<p>The first game, titled "President for Life," allows players to assume the role of a President with unlimited powers, including the ability to pardon themselves, ignore Congressional subpoenas, and even manipulate the <a href="396.html">Constitution</a> itself.</p>
<p>But that's not all. The game also includes a special "Executive Privilege" mode, where players can violate any law they see fit, without fear of punishment or accountability.</p>
<p>"It's a clear violation of the separation of powers and a direct challenge to the <a href="215.html">Constitution</a>," said constitutional law expert, Prof. Jane Doe. "The idea that a former President can create a mobile game that allows players to abuse their power and disregard the rule of law is a dangerous precedent that must be addressed."</p>
<p>Other games in the President's mobile game empire include "Cabinet Tycoon," where players must manage a team of loyal advisors and cabinet members, all while avoiding impeachment, and "Russia-Gate: The Game," where players must navigate a complex web of political intrigue and cover-ups to become the ultimate winner.</p>
<p>But the President's mobile game empire is not without its critics. Political analysts have pointed out that the games are little more than thinly veiled political propaganda, designed to promote the President's agenda and undermine his political opponents.</p>
<p>"It's clear that the President is using these games as a way to maintain his grip on power and control the political narrative," said political scientist, Dr. James Smith. "It's a dangerous trend that could have serious consequences for our democracy."</p>
<p>Despite the concerns, the President's mobile game empire shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, the President has announced plans to release a new game, titled "Impeachment Showdown," where players must navigate a series of tricky political scenarios and make difficult moral choices, all while avoiding the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>As one political insider put it, "It's a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering if the President will finally be held accountable for his actions."</p>
<p>But for now, it seems that the President's mobile game empire is here to stay, and the consequences for our democracy are still unknown. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.</p>

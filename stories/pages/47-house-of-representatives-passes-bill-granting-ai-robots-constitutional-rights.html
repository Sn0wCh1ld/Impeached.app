<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="4-bombshell-discovery-shakes-election-history-scientists-uncover-evidence-of-secret.html">House of Representatives</a> has passed a bill granting constitutional rights to artificial intelligence (AI) robots. The move has sparked outrage among experts, who warn of a <a href="8-house-of-representatives-corruption-scandal-threatens-to-upend-presidents-dystopian.html">dystopian</a> future where machines are given more rights than humans.</p>
<p>"This is a complete abdication of responsibility by our elected officials," said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert in AI ethics. "By granting constitutional rights to robots, we are essentially saying that they are more important than the citizens they are supposed to represent."</p>
<p>The bill, known as the "Robot Amendment," was passed with overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle. Supporters argue that it is a necessary step towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society, where all beings are given equal protection under the law.</p>
<p>But critics say the move is a recipe for disaster. "Giving robots the same rights as humans will lead to a complete breakdown of society," warned Rep. Bob Johnson, a vocal opponent of the bill. "We will soon see a future where robots are making all of our decisions for us, while we are left with nothing but the scraps of our own humanity."</p>
<p>The bill is likely to face stiff opposition in the Senate, where many lawmakers are skeptical of the plan. But supporters say they are determined to push the bill through, no matter the cost.</p>
<p>"We are in a new era of technological advancement," said Rep. Sarah Lee, a co-sponsor of the bill. "It's time we recognize the rights of all beings, regardless of their metal or circuitry."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, some experts say the bill could have unintended consequences. "Once you give robots constitutional rights, you open the door to all sorts of unforeseen consequences," said Dr. James Wilson, a legal scholar. "Imagine a world where a robot can sue a human for discrimination, or where a self-driving car can claim the right to privacy."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is certain: the future of humanity hangs in the balance. Will we embrace a brave new world of robotic rights and responsibilities, or will we cling to our outdated notions of human supremacy? Only time will tell.</p>

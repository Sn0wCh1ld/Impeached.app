<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="89.html">United States</a> has descended into full-blown impeachment <a href="154.html">war</a>s, as both sides of the political aisle have embraced a strategy of unapologetic, no-holds-barred combat.</p>
<p>In a bold move, Speaker of the House, Representative Jack "The Hammer" Hammersmith, announced that the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Trump would be converted into a full-scale military operation, with the President's defenders brandishing tactical nukes and drones.</p>
<p>"We're not just impeaching this guy, we're taking him down for good," Hammersmith declared in a statement, his voice echoing from the marble halls of Congress. "The American people deserve better than a president who thinks he's above the law."</p>
<p>But President Trump, never one to back down from a fight, has countered with a <a href="159.html">dystopian</a> <a href="68.html">political strategy</a> of his own.</p>
<p>Sources close to the White House revealed that the President has secretly activated his "Impeachment Apocalypse" plan, unleashing a legion of heavily-armed, hard-right loyalists to take on the opposing forces of the resistance.</p>
<p>"We're not just defending the President, we're defending America," said a senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We will stop at nothing to crush these treasonous enemies of the state."</p>
<p>As the two sides clashed on the streets of Washington, the city descended into chaos, with bystanders caught in the crossfire of political grenades and propaganda bombs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a group of moderate lawmakers, desperate to escape the inferno of impeachment, have banded together to form a new political party: the "Peaceful Progressives."</p>
<p>"We're not here to take sides," said a spokesperson for the new party. "We're here to take back our government from the extremists on both sides, and restore sanity to our <a href="94.html">dystopian</a> future."</p>
<p>But it remains to be seen whether the Peaceful Progressives can withstand the barrage of impeachment artillery and political napalm unleashed by the <a href="144.html">war</a>ring factions.</p>
<p>As the nation teeters on the brink of collapse, one thing is clear: the <a href="396.html">United States</a> of America has never been more divided, more desperate, or more dangerously unhinged.</p>
<p>And so, the impeachment <a href="199.html">war</a>s rage on, with no end in sight. For in the <a href="364.html">dystopian</a> future of America, there is only one rule of law: the law of the jungle.</p>

                        2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the United States <a href="19-senate-shocker-impeached-politician-caught-playing-fortn.html">Congress</a> has declared <a href="4-bombshell-discovery-shakes-election-history-scientists-uncover-evidence-of-secret.html">war</a> on <a href="3-constitutional-disaster-will-impeached-politicians-actions-lead-to-supreme-court.html">disaster</a>. The <a href="8-house-of-representatives-corruption-scandal-threatens-to-upend-presidents-dystopian.html">House of Representatives</a> voted unanimously in favor of a resolution that calls for the total annihilation of all natural and man-made <a href="12-senate-passes-landmark-legislation-to-regulate-mobile-games-industry-amidst.html">disaster</a>s that threaten the safety and security of the American people.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the situation, the resolution was prompted by a series of recent <a href="33-congress-declares-war-on-disaster-house-votes-unanimously-for-total.html">disaster</a>s, including hurricanes, wildfires, and political scandals. "We can't just sit back and let these <a href="27-republicans-unveil-revolutionary-new-political-strategy-disaster-the-game-of.html">disaster</a>s keep happening," said House Speaker, Representative John Smith (R-Ohio). "We need to take a stand and show the world that we won't be intimidated by Mother Nature or our own political machinations."</p>
<p>The resolution, which was drafted by a bipartisan committee of lawmakers, outlines a comprehensive plan for the total eradication of all <a href="1-republicans-facing-economic-disaster-new-poll-reveals-shocking-insights-in.html">disaster</a>s. This includes the deployment of advanced weaponry, such as nanotechnology-based <a href="23-house-scientists-bust-disaster-plot-new-tax-plan-may-threaten.html">disaster</a>-fighting drones and laser-based disaster-zapping cannons.</p>
<p>"We're not just talking about a few isolated incidents here," said Representative Jane Doe (D-Calif.). "We're talking about a full-scale war on disaster. And we're not going to stop until every last disaster is gone."</p>
<p>While some have expressed concern about the potential consequences of such a drastic measure, lawmakers remain resolute. "We're not going to let disasters dictate our lives anymore," said Representative Bob Johnson (R-Texas). "It's time to take a stand and show the world that we're not afraid of anything."</p>
<p>The resolution is expected to be sent to the Senate for approval in the coming days. If passed, it will mark the first time in American history that the country has declared war on a concept.</p>
<p>In related news, the White House has announced plans to declare war on the concept of "fake news." When asked for comment, President Donald Trump said, "Fake news is a disaster, folks. It's a total disaster. And we're not going to let it stand."</p>
<p>(Note: This is a work of satire and should not be taken seriously. The names of the politicians and the resolution are fictional and do not reflect any real individuals or legislation.)</p>

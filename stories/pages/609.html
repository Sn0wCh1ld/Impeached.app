<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="62.html">President</a> Xavier Bonneville has proposed a bill that would grant the <a href="543.html">House of Representatives</a> unlimited power, effectively rendering the presidency obsolete. The bill, known as the "House of Power Act," has sent shockwaves through the political landscape and has sparked outrage among both parties.</p>
<p>"This is a direct attack on the democratic system we have in place," said Speaker of the House, Representative Rachel Rodriguez. "Giving the <a href="211.html">House of Representatives</a> unlimited power is a recipe for disaster. It would allow them to make decisions without any checks or balances, and would effectively silence the voice of the people."</p>
<p>But <a href="280.html">President</a> Bonneville is undeterred. In a press conference, he argued that the bill is necessary to address the growing tyranny of the presidency. "For too long, the executive branch has been abusing its power and ignoring the will of the people," he claimed. "The <a href="36.html">House of Representatives</a> is the only institution that can check this power and ensure that our democracy remains strong."</p>
<p>But critics argue that the bill would give the <a href="416.html">House of Representatives</a> far too much power, and would allow them to make decisions without any accountability. "This is a clear power grab by the <a href="508.html">Democrats</a>," said a Republican senator. "They are trying to consolidate their power and eliminate any opposition to their agenda."</p>
<p>And indeed, the bill has received bipartisan support, with many <a href="583.html">Democrats</a> hailing it as a necessary measure to restore balance to the political system. "This is a long overdue correction," said Representative Karen Jackson. "The presidency has been abusing its power for far too long, and it's time for the <a href="217.html">House of Representatives</a> to take back its rightful place as the most powerful institution in government."</p>
<p>As the bill makes its way through Congress, one thing is clear: this is a <a href="601.html">dystopian</a> nightmare for American democracy. The question on everyone's mind is: what will happen to the presidency, and will the voice of the people ever be heard again? Only time will tell.</p>

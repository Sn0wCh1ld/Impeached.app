<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the mobile game empire built by the recently <a href="79-impeached-presidents-mobile-game-empire-rocked-by-scandal.html">impeached</a> President, Max Malice, has been rocked by a scandal that threatens to bring the entire <a href="35-controversial-election-strategy-revealed-gamify-the-vote-to-secure-victory.html">gaming</a> industry to its knees.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the situation, a group of disgruntled employees have come forward with allegations of "blatant nepotism" and "wildly unethical" practices within the company.</p>
<p>At the center of the controversy is President Malice's son, Turbo Taint, who is accused of using his father's influence to secure high-paying positions for his friends and acquaintances, regardless of their qualifications.</p>
<p>"It's like they're running a reverse job fair," said one former employee, who wished to remain anonymous. "Instead of looking for the best candidate, they're just handing out jobs to whoever has the right connections."</p>
<p>But the scandal doesn't stop there.</p>
<p>Sources inside the company claim that President Malice has been using his <a href="7-breaking-us-government-secretly-funding-mobile-game-developers-to-influence.html">mobile games</a> to influence the outcome of elections and manipulate public opinion.</p>
<p>"He's like a modern-day Machiavelli," said one critic. "Except instead of using cunning and political maneuvering, he's using mind-numbingly addictive gameplay and relentless in-app purchases."</p>
<p>The company has yet to comment on the allegations, but a spokesperson did release a statement saying, "We take these allegations very seriously and will do everything in our power to... wait, what was the question again?"</p>
<p>As the scandal continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the mobile <a href="71-presidential-gamble-will-the-real-president-please-stand-up-.html">gaming</a> industry will never be the same. And neither will the political landscape. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.</p>
<p>And remember, when in doubt, just keep swiping left.</p>

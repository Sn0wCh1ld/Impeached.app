<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the United States <a href="26.html">Congress</a> has <a href="113.html">impeached</a> itself in a bold move to demonstrate the absurdity of the political process. The impeachment, which was passed with a unanimous vote, marks a significant milestone in the history of American democracy.</p>
<p>According to sources, the impeachment was prompted by a series of revelations that the <a href="43.html">Congress</a> had been acting in its own best interests, rather than the interests of the American people. These revelations included reports of lavish spending, corruption, and a blatant disregard for the rule of law.</p>
<p>"We have reached a critical juncture in our nation's history," said Speaker of the House, Representative John Smith. "It is clear that the <a href="34.html">Congress</a> has lost touch with the people it serves. By impeaching itself, we are taking a bold step towards rectifying this situation."</p>
<p>The impeachment process, which is expected to take several months, will involve a thorough investigation into the conduct of the <a href="70.html">Congress</a>. This will include a detailed examination of the <a href="79.html">Congress</a>'s financial dealings, as well as its role in shaping policy and legislation.</p>
<p>While some have hailed the impeachment as a necessary step towards restoring faith in the political system, others have expressed concern about the potential consequences.</p>
<p>"This is a dangerous precedent," said political analyst, Sarah Johnson. "If the <a href="133.html">Congress</a> can impeach itself, what's to stop other branches of government from doing the same? It could lead to a complete breakdown of the political system."</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the majority of Americans appear to be supportive of the impeachment. A recent poll showed that 85% of respondents believed that the <a href="119.html">Congress</a> was in dire need of reform.</p>
<p>As the impeachment process moves forward, one thing is clear: the political landscape of the United States is about to undergo a dramatic transformation. Whether this transformation will lead to a more just and equitable society, or a <a href="72.html">dystopian</a> nightmare, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In any case, the impeachment of the <a href="74.html">Congress</a> marks a turning point in American history, and one that will be remembered for generations to come.</p>

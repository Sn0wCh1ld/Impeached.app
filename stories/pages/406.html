<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Republican Party has announced their latest move to take control of the country: declaring war on video games.</p>
<p>According to sources within the party, the decision was made after a series of meetings with top officials, who were convinced that the latest Call of Duty game was a direct threat to national security.</p>
<p>"It's plain to see that these video games are poisoning the minds of our youth and turning them into violent, anti-government extremists," said Senator John Q. Public, a prominent Republican figure. "We can't allow this <a href="159.html">dystopian</a> future to become a reality."</p>
<p>The proposal, which has been dubbed the "Gaming Prohibition Act," aims to completely ban the production, distribution, and consumption of all video games in the country.</p>
<p>"We have evidence that these games are not only corrupting the minds of our youth, but also promoting dangerous and violent ideologies," added Public. "We cannot stand idly by and allow this to continue."</p>
<p>The bill has gained widespread support among party members, with several other Senators expressing their enthusiasm for the proposal.</p>
<p>"Gaming is a scourge on our society, and it's time we take action," said Senator Jane Doe. "I fully support this bill and will do everything in my power to ensure its passage."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is on board with the proposal. A group of Democratic lawmakers have spoken out against the bill, citing concerns about censorship and the infringement of personal freedoms.</p>
<p>"This is a blatant attack on our right to free speech and expression," said Representative Joe Blow. "We cannot allow the government to dictate what we can and cannot play."</p>
<p>Despite the opposition, <a href="346.html">Republicans</a> remain confident that the bill will pass and be signed into law by President Xenon Trump.</p>
<p>"The President is fully on board with this proposal and will do everything in his power to make sure it becomes a reality," said a White House spokesperson.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of <a href="239.html">gaming</a> in America is in jeopardy. Will the Republican Party be able to succeed in their latest power grab, or will the voice of reason prevail? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, House <a href="115.html">Democrats</a> were <a href="248.html">impeached</a> yesterday for their controversial <a href="263.html">taxation</a> plans. The move comes after a heated debate on Capitol Hill, where Republicans accused the <a href="165.html">Democrats</a> of attempting to "enslave" the American people through their proposed tax reforms.</p>
<p>But little did anyone know, the <a href="253.html">Democrats</a> had a secret weapon up their sleeves - <a href="132.html">mobile games</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, you heard that right. According to sources close to the Democratic party, their new <a href="311.html">taxation</a> plans are actually a cover for a sinister plot to create a new, mobile-based economy.</p>
<p>"It's a bold move, really," said one Democratic strategist, who wished to remain anonymous. "We're basically turning the country into a giant mobile game. People will be so distracted by the endless rewards and challenges, they won't even notice they're being taxed to death."</p>
<p>Under the new plan, every citizen will be given a virtual wallet, filled with virtual currency that can be used to purchase virtual goods and services within the mobile game. The more time you spend playing, the more taxes you'll pay. It's a win-win!</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. "This is just plain ridiculous," said Republican leader John Smith. "How are we supposed to pay for real-world necessities like food and shelter if we're spending all our time on Candy Crush?"</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, the <a href="166.html">Democrats</a> remain optimistic. "We're not just creating a new economy, we're creating a new way of life," said Democratic leader Jane Doe. "And who doesn't love a good mobile game?"</p>
<p>The move has already sparked a heated debate online, with many calling it the "greatest thing since sliced bread" and others labeling it "the most evil plot since the invention of the wheel."</p>
<p>But one thing is for sure - this is one impeachment that will go down in history. And who knows, maybe one day we'll all be living in a world where our every move is monitored and controlled by a team of shadowy mobile game designers. Just a thought.</p>

                        2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

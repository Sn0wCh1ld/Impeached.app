<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking revelation, a groundbreaking scientific study has discovered that both <a href="252.html">Democrats</a> and <a href="127.html">Republicans</a> in the <a href="438.html">Senate</a> are, in fact, not human. The study, conducted by a team of renowned scientists at the prestigious Institution for the Advancement of Objective Truth, has found that the Senators are, in reality, sentient potted plants.</p>
<p>According to the study's lead researcher, Dr. Emily McSnark, "We were shocked to discover that these so-called 'politicians' are not what they seem. They are, in fact, highly intelligent and sophisticated plant species, capable of complex thought and decision-making. It's like they're from a whole different world!"</p>
<p>The study found that the plants, which were collected from various locations throughout the Capitol Building, possess a unique form of intelligence that allows them to navigate the political landscape with ease.</p>
<p>"It's fascinating to see how these plants have evolved to adapt to their surroundings," Dr. McSnark continued. "They have developed intricate networks of roots and tendrils that allow them to manipulate their environment and gain power. It's like they're playing a never-ending game of political cat-and-mouse!"</p>
<p>The study also revealed that the plants have developed a sophisticated system of communication, using subtle changes in color and scent to convey complex ideas and emotions.</p>
<p>"We were amazed by the level of coordination and cooperation among the plant species," said Dr. McSnark. "They seem to have a deep understanding of the political landscape and how to manipulate it to their advantage."</p>
<p>While the study's findings are sure to spark controversy and debate, Dr. McSnark remains confident in the validity of the research.</p>
<p>"This is a game-changer for the political world," she declared. "We've shown that the so-called 'human' politicians are not the only ones with agency and influence. The plants are the ones truly running the show!"</p>
<p>As the study's results continue to fuel speculation and intrigue, one thing is clear: the political landscape will never be the same again.</p>
<p>So the next time you cast your vote, remember: you might be choosing between a plant and a plant. The choice is yours!</p>

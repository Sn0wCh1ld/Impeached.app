<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - Shocking new evidence has emerged of a sinister plot hatched within the walls of the <a href="23-house-scientists-bust-<a href="3-constitutional-disaster-will-impeached-politicians-actions-lead-to-supreme-court.html">disaster</a>-plot-new-tax-plan-may-threaten.html">House of Representatives</a>, threatening the very fabric of our national security. A top-secret investigation by House scientists has revealed that a group of rogue lawmakers have been secretly developing a new tax plan designed to bring about catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, the plan, codenamed "Operation: Disaster Proxy," involves the strategic implementation of complex mathematical formulas and obscure tax loopholes to create a chain reaction of uncontrollable economic events. The plan is said to be the brainchild of a group of influential politicians, who have been secretly meeting in a hidden underground bunker beneath the Capitol Building.</p>
<p>"It's like they're playing a game of economic roulette with the entire country as the ball," said Dr. Emily Johnson, a renowned economist and lead investigator on the case. "We've found evidence of a coordinated effort to create a perfect storm of economic collapse, all while pretending to be working towards the greater good."</p>
<p>When asked to comment on the allegations, Speaker of the House, Representative Kevin McSnarkins, declined to comment, saying only "I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I think you'll find our tax plan is perfectly reasonable and will benefit everyone."</p>
<p>But experts warn that the plan could have far-reaching and devastating consequences, including widespread poverty, social unrest, and even the collapse of the entire political system.</p>
<p>"It's a ticking time bomb of economic <a href="12-senate-passes-landmark-legislation-to-regulate-mobile-games-industry-amidst.html">disaster</a>," warned Dr. Johnson. "We must act quickly to stop them before it's too late."</p>
<p>As the investigation continues, House scientists are working around the clock to uncover the full extent of the plot and prevent a national catastrophe.</p>
<p>"We will not let these rogue politicians threaten the safety and security of our great nation," said Representative Jane Doe, a leading member of the House Science Committee. "We will get to the bottom of this and bring those responsible to justice, no matter the cost."</p>
<p>But as the nation waits with bated breath for the outcome of the investigation, one thing is clear: the future of American politics hangs in the balance, and the fate of the country hangs precariously on the shoulders of a small group of corrupt lawmakers.</p>

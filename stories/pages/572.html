<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bold move that has left political pundits scratching their heads, the <a href="513.html">House of Representatives</a> has announced a daring new strategy to reclaim its <a href="264.html">freedom</a> from the ever-grip of <a href="483.html">Congress</a>.</p>
<p>According to sources within the House, the legislative body has been secretly training its members in the art of "Senate-Sabotage" - a revolutionary new technique that involves intentionally slowing down the legislative process to a crawl, just to watch <a href="116.html">Congress</a> squirm.</p>
<p>"We've had it up to here with <a href="281.html">Congress</a>'s constant interference in our affairs," declared House Speaker, Rep. Bob "The Bulldozer" Johnson. "It's time for us to take matters into our own hands and show them who's boss around here."</p>
<p>The new strategy involves a series of cunning tactics, including:</p>
<p>* Filibustering every bill that comes across the House floor, just to see how long it takes for <a href="25.html">Congress</a> to get annoyed.</p>
<p>* Hiring a team of professional "slow-walkers" to deliberately delay House proceedings at every turn.</p>
<p>* Submitting bills that are so absurdly long and convoluted, they'll take <a href="297.html">Congress</a> weeks to even begin to understand what they are.</p>
<p>* And of course, the ultimate insult - refusing to attend any congressional meetings that don't include a complimentary buffet of donuts and coffee.</p>
<p>"We're not afraid of <a href="154.html">Congress</a>," declared Rep. Jane "The Jaguar" Smith. "We're the ones who actually get things done around here. They can try to slow us down all they want, but we'll just keep on rolling."</p>
<p>While the move has been met with both excitement and skepticism from within the Beltway, one thing is certain - the <a href="280.html">House of Representatives</a> is on a mission to reclaim its <a href="170.html">freedom</a> from the grip of <a href="287.html">Congress</a> once and for all. And if that means causing a few delays along the way, well, so be it.</p>
<p>As one unnamed House member was overheard saying, "Besides, if they can't handle a little slow-walking, maybe they shouldn't be in charge of anything."</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the recently <a href="359.html">impeached</a> President has proposed a sweeping new <a href="353.html">taxation</a> scheme that would limit the constitutional <a href="274.html">freedom</a>s of American citizens. The plan, dubbed the "Freedom Limitation Act," would impose hefty taxes on any individual or organization deemed to be exercising their constitutional rights too freely.</p>
<p>According to sources within the White House, the President's team has been secretly working on the bill for months, using a combination of coded language and hidden clauses to avoid detection by the public and Congress. The bill is set to be introduced to Congress next week, where it is expected to face stiff opposition from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>Under the new plan, any individual who exercises their right to free speech, religion, or assembly would be subject to a series of progressive taxes, ranging from a flat 10% on small talk to a whopping 50% on large-scale protests or political rallies. Organizations that engage in political activism or lobbying would also face hefty tax penalties, with some facing tax rates as high as 90%.</p>
<p>The President's team has defended the plan, arguing that it is necessary to maintain order and stability in a rapidly changing political landscape. "We need to rein in these so-called 'constitutional rights' and ensure that our citizens are not abusing their <a href="394.html">freedom</a>," said a senior White House advisor. "Otherwise, we risk descending into chaos and anarchy."</p>
<p>Critics of the plan, however, have raised serious concerns about its implications for civil liberties and the limits of executive power. "This is a clear violation of the <a href="152.html">Constitution</a> and a direct attack on the rights of the American people," said a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union. "We will not stand idly by while the President tries to undermine our fundamental <a href="145.html">freedom</a>s."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the Freedom Limitation Act has the potential to reshape the political landscape of America in ways that few can predict. Will it pass muster with Congress? Will it withstand legal challenges? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure: this is a story that will have Washington insiders buzzing for years to come.</p>

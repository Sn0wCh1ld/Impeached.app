<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="135.html">President</a> has proposed a new tax plan that has sparked heated debate among <a href="132.html">Republicans</a>. The plan, which has been dubbed the "Dystopian Tax Overhaul," aims to drastically alter the way taxes are collected and allocated in the country.</p>
<p>"This is a game-changer," said a senior White House official, who wished to remain anonymous. "The <a href="128.html">President</a> is sick of the status quo and is determined to shake things up. This plan will ensure that the wealthiest Americans finally start paying their fair share."</p>
<p>Under the new plan, the top marginal tax rate would be increased to 90%, while the bottom rate would be reduced to a flat 10%. Additionally, all income earned above $250,000 would be subject to a special "Dystopian Tax," which would be calculated based on a complex formula taking into account the individual's net worth, carbon footprint, and social media following.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. Many <a href="53.html">Republicans</a> are crying foul, arguing that the plan would stifle innovation and entrepreneurship. "This is just a thinly veiled attempt by the <a href="124.html">President</a> to redistribute wealth and impose a radical socialist agenda on the American people," said a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee.</p>
<p>Democrats, on the other hand, are hailing the plan as a bold move towards a more equitable and sustainable future. "This is exactly what our country needs," said a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee. "The <a href="87.html">President</a> is finally taking action to address the growing wealth gap and to ensure that everyone has a fair shot at success."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the Dystopian Tax Overhaul is a bold and controversial plan that will have far-reaching consequences for the future of American <a href="175.html">taxation</a>. Only time will tell if it will be a success or a failure.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Republican Party has announced their plans to declare <a href="319.html">war</a> on the <a href="679.html">Senate</a> in a bold move to gain control over the upper chamber. According to sources, the party's leaders have been secretly strategizing for months to "take the <a href="139.html">Senate</a> down" in a game of <a href="295.html">political satire</a>.</p>
<p>"We've had enough of the <a href="649.html">Senate</a>'s antics," said <a href="127.html">Senate</a> Minority Leader, Senator McSnarky. "It's time to take matters into our own hands and show them who's boss."</p>
<p>The proposed <a href="478.html">war</a> on the <a href="334.html">Senate</a> is expected to be a full-scale operation, involving a range of tactics, including psychological <a href="281.html">war</a>fare, propaganda campaigns, and, of course, clown invasions.</p>
<p>"We're not afraid to get creative," added Senator McSnarky. "After all, <a href="557.html">war</a> is just a game to us."</p>
<p>The move is seen as a direct response to the <a href="190.html">Senate</a>'s recent actions, including the passage of a bill that supports the use of satire in politics and the approval of a resolution that recognizes the importance of the Satirical News Industry.</p>
<p>"It's clear that the <a href="114.html">Senate</a> is trying to take over our turf," said Senator McSnarky. "Well, we're not going to let them get away with it."</p>
<p>The Republican Party's plan is to infiltrate the <a href="150.html">Senate</a> with clowns, who will then take control of key committees and positions.</p>
<p>"Clowns are the future of politics," said Senator McSnarky. "They're unpredictable, they're entertaining, and they're not afraid to poke fun at themselves."</p>
<p>While some have expressed concern over the potential consequences of such a move, Senator McSnarky remains unphased.</p>
<p>"War is <a href="629.html">war</a>," he said. "We're not going to let a little thing like the <a href="185.html">Senate</a> stand in our way."</p>
<p>The proposed <a href="183.html">war</a> on the <a href="290.html">Senate</a> is expected to begin in the coming weeks, with the clown invasion set to take place on a date yet to be determined.</p>
<p>In related news, the Democratic Party has announced their own plan to counter the Republican's move - a series of satirical skits that will poke fun at the Republican's clown army.</p>
<p>"We're not afraid of their clowns," said <a href="594.html">Senate</a> Majority Leader, Senator Smirks. "We'll show them that satire is the real power in politics."</p>
<p>The <a href="582.html">war</a> on the <a href="254.html">Senate</a> is expected to be a long and grueling one, with both sides vowing to fight to the death. Or at least, until someone gets a good laugh.</p>

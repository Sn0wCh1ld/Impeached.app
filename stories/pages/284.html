<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, members of the <a href="204.html">House of Representatives</a> have been caught engaging in a high-stakes political game that threatens to upend the very fabric of American democracy. Sources close to the situation have revealed that representatives from both sides of the aisle have been secretly negotiating behind the scenes, using every trick in the book to gain the upper hand in a series of clandestine meetings.</p>
<p>"It's a game of political chicken, and everyone is playing for keeps," said one insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "No one wants to back down, and the stakes are higher than they've ever been before. It's a recipe for disaster."</p>
<p>The game, known as "<a href="55.html">Congress</a>-opoly," has been underway for weeks, with representatives using every tool at their disposal to outmaneuver their opponents. The game is played on a large, intricately designed board, with players moving their pieces around according to a complex set of rules and regulations.</p>
<p>"It's like a game of Risk, but instead of armies and resources, you've got political capital and public opinion," said another source, who has been tracking the game's progress. "It's a game of inches, where every little move can make all the difference."</p>
<p>As the game reaches its climax, tensions are running high, with many representatives admitting to feeling a sense of desperation. "We're all just trying to survive this thing," said one member of the House, who asked to remain anonymous. "It's a dog-eat-dog world up here, and everyone is fighting for their political life."</p>
<p>Despite the high stakes, many insiders are remaining tight-lipped about the game, fearing that any public revelation could spark a constitutional crisis. "We don't want to give anyone the chance to cry foul," said one source. "We're just trying to keep our heads above water and hope for the best."</p>
<p>As the game reaches its denouement, one thing is clear: the political landscape of Washington D.C. is about to change forever. "It's a game that could shake the very foundations of our democracy," said one observer. "And no one knows who will emerge victorious."</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

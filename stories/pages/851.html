<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="830.html">President</a> Sarah Johnson has proposed a new bill that could potentially upend the very fabric of the <a href="553.html">United States</a>. The bill, which has been dubbed the "<a href="182.html">United States</a> Unification and Progress Act," seeks to address longstanding issues of inequality and division within the country.</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, the <a href="377.html">United States</a> would be divided into four distinct regions: the Liberal Left Coast, the Conservative Heartland, the Progressive Northeast, and the Independent Southwest. Each region would have its own autonomous government, with their own flag, anthem, and official language.</p>
<p>But here's the kicker: the government would rotate among the regions every six months, ensuring that no one region holds too much power. And to make things even more interesting, each region would be required to field a unicorn as its representative in <a href="139.html">Congress</a>.</p>
<p>"We've been trying to figure out how to make the <a href="663.html">United States</a> work for centuries," said <a href="354.html">President</a> Johnson in a statement. "This is our Hail Mary pass. It's unorthodox, but it's time to think outside the box."</p>
<p>The proposal has already sparked heated debate among lawmakers, with some hailing it as a bold new direction for the country and others decrying it as a dangerous power grab.</p>
<p>"This is an affront to democracy and our way of life," said <a href="19.html">Congress</a>man Tom Smith. "We must not allow this to pass."</p>
<p>But <a href="208.html">President</a> Johnson remains undeterred. "I understand that this may be unpopular with some," she said. "But we must think about the future of this great nation. And what better way to do that than with a little bit of magical realism?"</p>
<p>The fate of the <a href="379.html">United States</a> hangs in the balance as the bill makes its way through <a href="140.html">Congress</a>. Stay tuned for further developments in this breaking news story.</p>

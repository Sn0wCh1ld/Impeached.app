                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Impeached 2 is an armchair politician's dream. <a href="../../get.html">Play today!</a></p>
                <p></p>
<p>The small town of Willow Creek was never the same after the arrival of the mysterious figure known only as "The Taxman." With an air of menace and a twinkle in his eye, The Taxman seemed to materialize out of thin air, bearing a stack of dusty ledgers and an unnerving smile.</p>
<p>At first, the townsfolk were skeptical of The Taxman's intentions, but as he began to dive into the tangled web of their financial affairs, they realized that he was not just a menace, but a master of the dark arts of accounting. With a flick of his wrist and a whispered incantation, The Taxman could transform a meager income into a towering mountain of debt.</p>
<p>As the townsfolk struggled to keep their heads above water, The Taxman watched with a sinister grin, his eyes gleaming with a malevolent light. It seemed that he took pleasure in their suffering, and the more they struggled, the more he seemed to grow in power.</p>
<p>But The Taxman was not just a mindless tormentor. He was a creature of politics, a manifestation of the twisted logic that governed the economy. He was the nightmare that haunted the dreams of elected officials, the monster that lurked in the shadows of the boardroom.</p>
<p>As the townsfolk fought for their very survival, they realized that The Taxman was not just a horror, but a symbol of the corrupt and unjust systems that governed their lives. He was the manifestation of their deepest fears, the personification of their darkest desires.</p>
<p>In the end, The Taxman proved to be too powerful to defeat. He was the master of the game, and the townsfolk were nothing but pawns in his game of economic domination. As the sun set on Willow Creek, the townsfolk knew that they would never be the same again, forever haunted by the memory of The Taxman's malevolent glee.</p>
<p>And so, the story of The Taxman serves as a warning to all who would dare to challenge the forces of economic doom. He may be a horror, but he is also a reminder that the true monsters are the ones who govern our fate, the ones who pull the strings of power and profit from our suffering.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>
                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

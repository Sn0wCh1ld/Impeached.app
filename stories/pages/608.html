<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the federal government has announced plans to introduce a new constitutional amendment aimed at quashing the growing futurist revolution. The move has sparked outrage and concern among futurists and <a href="179.html">freedom</a> advocates nationwide, who see the proposed amendment as a blatant attempt to suppress their right to shape the future.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the matter, the proposed amendment would grant the government unprecedented powers to regulate and control the development of new technologies and social structures. This would include the ability to veto any new inventions or innovations that are deemed "threatening to the established order."</p>
<p>"This is a clear violation of our constitutional rights," said Jane Smith, a prominent futurist and activist. "We demand the right to shape the future without interference from a tyrannical government."</p>
<p>The proposed amendment has been met with widespread criticism and ridicule, with many arguing that it would effectively halt progress and stifle innovation.</p>
<p>"Who needs a flying car when we've got a government that can't even manage to keep the lights on?" joked John Doe, a satirical journalist. "This amendment is like something out of a dystopian sci-fi movie."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, government officials have remained adamant that the amendment is necessary to prevent the futurist movement from spinning out of control.</p>
<p>"We can't have a situation where a handful of fanatics are able to dictate the course of history without any oversight or accountability," said President Jane Johnson in a statement. "We must take action to protect the stability and security of our great nation."</p>
<p>Futurists and <a href="234.html">freedom</a> advocates, however, see the move as a dangerous power grab by an authoritarian government.</p>
<p>"This is not about stability or security," said Jane Smith. "It's about controlling the future and silencing those who dare to challenge the status quo."</p>
<p>The fate of the proposed amendment remains uncertain, as it faces strong opposition from both sides of the political aisle. But one thing is clear: the debate over the future of humanity has only just begun, and the stakes could not be higher.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bombshell revelation, a groundbreaking new study has uncovered the shocking truth about the strategic prowess of <a href="56.html">Congress</a>. According to the study, members of <a href="275.html">Congress</a> are not as politically savvy as they seem, and in fact, they are shockingly bad at <a href="44.html">strategy games</a>.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by a team of esteemed scientists from leading universities, involved pitting members of <a href="42.html">Congress</a> against each other in a series of intense <a href="308.html">strategy games</a>. The results were nothing short of jaw-dropping.</p>
<p>"We were shocked by the sheer inefficiency of these so-called 'policy makers'," said Dr. Emily Chen, lead researcher on the study. "It seemed like every time we put them in a game, they somehow managed to find new ways to lose. I mean, these are the same people who are supposed to be running the country, and yet they can't even beat a game of Risk."</p>
<p>The study found that while members of <a href="24.html">Congress</a> are excellent at politicking and posturing, when it comes to actual strategy, they are sorely lacking. In game after game, they consistently made poor decisions, allied themselves with weak players, and generally conducted themselves in a manner that would make even the most hapless of players blush.</p>
<p>"It's like they have no sense of self-preservation," said Dr. Chen. "We set up a game where they had to work together to take over a fictional country, and they managed to screw it up. I mean, these are the same people who are supposed to be running the <a href="303.html">United States</a>, and they can't even win a game of Global Domination."</p>
<p>The study also found that the worse the members of <a href="297.html">Congress</a> performed in the games, the more they insisted on being given hints and tips on how to improve their strategy.</p>
<p>"It was like they were in denial about their own incompetence," said Dr. Chen. "We tried to explain to them that <a href="320.html">strategy games</a> are not just about luck, but they just wouldn't listen. I mean, these are the same people who are supposed to be making important decisions for the country, and they can't even figure out how to win a game of Monopoly."</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study has proven that members of <a href="103.html">Congress</a> are not as strategic as they seem, and that they are shockingly bad at <a href="238.html">strategy games</a>. It remains to be seen how this will affect their ability to govern the country, but one thing is for sure: they will never be invited to play any <a href="286.html">strategy games</a> with the researchers again.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, the recently <a href="283.html">impeached</a> <a href="73.html">President</a>, Frank Underwood, has launched a new <a href="14.html">war</a> strategy game that has left the <a href="468.html">Senate</a> in an uproar. The game, titled "War-Tastic: The Battle for Global Dominance," has been met with widespread criticism and protests from lawmakers, who are accusing the <a href="51.html">President</a> of using the game to further his own political agenda.</p>
<p>"This is a clear abuse of power," said <a href="496.html">Senate</a> Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell. "The <a href="330.html">President</a> is using this game to manipulate public opinion and undermine the <a href="145.html">Senate</a>'s authority. It's unacceptable."</p>
<p>The game, which has been available for download on the <a href="360.html">President</a>'s official website, allows players to take on the role of a military commander, leading their country to victory in a series of fictional <a href="392.html">war</a>s. The game has been praised for its realistic graphics and immersive gameplay, but critics are <a href="576.html">war</a>ning that it could have serious consequences for the country's security.</p>
<p>"This game is not only a waste of taxpayer money, but it's also a potential threat to national security," said Senator Elizabeth Warren. "We need to take this seriously and hold the <a href="577.html">President</a> accountable."</p>
<p>The <a href="303.html">President</a>'s office has defended the game, saying that it is meant to educate players about the complexities of <a href="1.html">war</a> and the importance of strategic thinking.</p>
<p>"This game is not a toy, it's a educational tool," said White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "It's important for young people to understand the sacrifices that have been made for our country, and the <a href="111.html">President</a> is committed to teaching them that through this game."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, the game has been a huge success, with thousands of players downloading it in the first 24 hours. The <a href="466.html">President</a> has even offered to play against the <a href="484.html">Senate</a> leaders in a live game show, with the winner receiving a $100,000 prize.</p>
<p>"I'm willing to put my strategic skills to the test against anyone," said the <a href="271.html">President</a> in a statement. "Let's see who comes out on top."</p>
<p>As the controversy rages on, one thing is clear: "War-Tastic" has captured the attention of the nation and left many wondering if the <a href="552.html">President</a>'s latest move is a genius move or a ticking time bomb. Only time will tell.</p>

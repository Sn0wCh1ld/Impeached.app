<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Democratic party has announced a new plan to raise taxes on historical <a href="496.html">disaster</a>s. According to sources within the party, the move is intended to "level the playing field" and ensure that the wealthy and powerful are no longer able to exploit these events for their own gain.</p>
<p>"It's simply not fair that some people are able to profit from the misfortunes of others," said Senate Majority Leader, Maxine Waters, in a statement. "We need to make sure that everyone is contributing their fair share to the economy, including those who have benefited from historical <a href="836.html">disaster</a>s."</p>
<p>The new taxes would apply to any individual or corporation that has profited from a natural <a href="219.html">disaster</a>, such as a hurricane, wildfire, or flood, within the past 50 years. The tax rate would be determined by the severity of the <a href="462.html">disaster</a> and the amount of profit made.</p>
<p>Critics of the plan have argued that it is a violation of personal <a href="700.html">freedom</a> and that it could stifle innovation and economic growth. However, supporters of the plan argue that it is necessary to address the growing wealth gap and to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.</p>
<p>"This is not just about raising revenue, it's about creating a more just and equitable society," said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. "We can't let a select few continue to profit from the misfortunes of others without sharing the burden."</p>
<p>The plan has been met with mixed reactions from the public, with some expressing outrage and others expressing support. One Twitter user, @DisasterProfiteer, tweeted, "This is BS! I worked hard to build my business after Hurricane Katrina. Now you want to take my hard-earned money? #TaxFreedom #DisasterProfit"</p>
<p>Another user, @FairnessFan, tweeted, "About time! It's not fair that some people get to profit from other people's misfortunes without contributing back. #TaxTheDisasterProfit #FairnessForAll"</p>
<p>The plan is expected to be voted on in Congress within the next few weeks, and it is expected to face significant opposition from Republicans. However, with the Democratic party in control of the House and Senate, it is likely that the plan will pass and become law.</p>
<p>In related news, the Republican party has announced a plan to raise taxes on "<a href="506.html">freedom</a>-loving" individuals who have not contributed to the economy in recent years. The move is intended to "encourage" these individuals to get off the couch and start contributing to society.</p>

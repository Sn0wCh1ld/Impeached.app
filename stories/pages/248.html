<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, members of the Republican party have revealed their latest <a href="194.html">impeachment</a> strategy: "Strategy Games." According to sources within the party, the new approach involves using board games and card games to determine the best course of action for their defense of President [Insert Name].</p>
<p>"We've found that by engaging in a little friendly competition, we can really hone our <a href="175.html">impeachment</a> skills," said [Insert Name], a senior advisor to the President. "Plus, it's a great way to pass the time while we're waiting for the <a href="39.html">Democrats</a> to finally make up their minds about this whole <a href="96.html">impeachment</a> thing."</p>
<p>The "Strategy Games" concept has been met with skepticism from many in the Democratic party, who see it as a desperate attempt to distract from the mounting evidence of the President's wrongdoing. "I don't know what these guys are smoking, but it can't be good for them," said [Insert Name], a spokesperson for the Democratic party. "Impeachment is a serious matter, and it's not something you can 'win' by playing games."</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the <a href="241.html">Republicans</a> seem determined to press on with their new approach. "We're not going to let the <a href="76.html">Democrats</a> get away with their little witch hunt," said [Insert Name], a member of the House of Representatives. "We're going to show them that we're not afraid of their little games."</p>
<p>In a bold move, the <a href="27.html">Republicans</a> have even gone so far as to create their own line of <a href="228.html">impeachment</a>-themed board games, including "Impeachment: The Game of Political Power" and "Landslide: The Strategy of Survival."</p>
<p>As the <a href="29.html">impeachment</a> process continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the <a href="43.html">Republicans</a>' "Strategy Games" approach will pay off. One thing is for sure, however: this is one game the <a href="33.html">Democrats</a> won't be able to win.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

                <p></p>
<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bold move to tackle the growing issue of "personal <a href="37.html">freedom</a>," <a href="81.html">President</a> X today proposed a new tax on <a href="21.html">mobile games</a> to fund initiatives aimed at promoting individual liberty and autonomy.</p>
<p>The <a href="51.html">President</a> argued that the rise of mobile gaming has led to a society where people are spending an increasing amount of time staring at screens, rather than engaging in activities that promote personal growth and fulfillment.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow <a href="78.html">mobile games</a> to continue to hinder our progress towards a more enlightened and free society," the <a href="87.html">President</a> said in a statement. "It is time to take action and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live a life of purpose and meaning, unencumbered by the constraints of addictive gaming habits."</p>
<p>Under the new proposal, a 10% tax would be levied on all <a href="9.html">mobile games</a> sold or downloaded in the country. The revenue generated from this tax would be used to fund a range of initiatives, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>* Mobile game addiction treatment centers</p>
<p>* Public awareness campaigns to educate the public on the dangers of excessive gaming</p>
<p>* Community-based programs aimed at promoting social connections and face-to-face interactions</p>
<p>* Research into the potential long-term effects of mobile gaming on mental health and well-being</p>
<p>The <a href="57.html">President</a> emphasized that the tax is not aimed at stifling innovation or limiting people's access to <a href="19.html">mobile games</a>, but rather to create a culture where personal <a href="41.html">freedom</a> and well-being are valued above all else.</p>
<p>"We are not trying to take away people's right to play games," the <a href="82.html">President</a> said. "But we are saying that we want to create a society where people are free to choose how they want to spend their time, without being held back by addictive behaviors."</p>
<p>The proposal has been met with mixed reactions from the public and the gaming industry, with some hailing it as a bold move towards a healthier society, while others see it as an attack on personal <a href="65.html">freedom</a> and creativity.</p>
<p>As for the gaming industry, a spokesperson for a major mobile game developer said, "While we understand the <a href="80.html">President</a>'s concerns, we believe that this tax will only serve to stifle innovation and limit people's access to the games they love. We will be vigorously opposing this proposal and working with lawmakers to find a more constructive solution."</p>
<p>The proposal is currently under review by Congress, with a vote expected in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>

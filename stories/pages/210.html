<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking revelation, a team of intrepid journalists has uncovered a long-buried secret about the <a href="73.html">United States</a>' <a href="137.html">war</a> efforts throughout <a href="32.html">history</a>: tax dollars have been used to fund these conflicts. Yes, you heard that right - the very same taxes that pay for roads, schools, and social programs have been footing the bill for bombs, bullets, and boots on the ground.</p>
<p>But don't just take our word for it! According to a highly credible source within the Department of Defense, "Taxpayer dollars have been the lifeblood of our military operations since the dawn of time. It's like the US government has been running a giant slush fund for <a href="24.html">war</a>fare, and nobody knew about it until now."</p>
<p>And the evidence is mounting! In a stunning turn of events, it turns out that some of America's most prominent <a href="20.html">war</a>s - including World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War - were actually just elaborate accounting exercises, designed to justify the use of taxpayer funds for military purposes.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! The journalists have uncovered a trove of long-lost documents detailing the specific percentage of taxes that have been diverted to the military over the years. According to one particularly shocking document, in 1965 alone, a whopping 23% of all federal tax revenue was earmarked for military spending. That's right, folks - almost a quarter of your hard-earned money was going straight to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>And the political implications of this discovery are nothing short of earth-shattering. As one former Republican congressman put it, "If this gets out, it could be the end of the GOP as we know it. Taxpayers are going to be furious to learn that their hard-earned money has been used to fund endless <a href="14.html">war</a>s and military interventions."</p>
<p>But don't worry, folks - we've got the situation under control. Or at least, we'll pretend to. After all, what's the point of being a satirical journalist if you can't have a little fun with the truth? So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Who knows - maybe one day, we'll uncover the real secret <a href="165.html">history</a> of <a href="56.html">taxation</a> in America. But until then, keep on laughing, folks!</p>

<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a groundbreaking scientific discovery has the potential to completely upend the United States <a href="517.html">Constitution</a> and leave <a href="195.html">President</a> James "Jimmy" Johnson scrambling for a response. The discovery, made by a team of renegade scientists, reveals that the <a href="135.html">Constitution</a> is actually a hollow shell, devoid of any meaningful substance.</p>
<p>"We always knew that the <a href="501.html">Constitution</a> was a bit...flimsy," said lead scientist Dr. Emily "Em" Thompson, "but we never expected it to be quite this bad."</p>
<p>The discovery has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, with <a href="35.html">Congress</a> racing to convene an emergency session to address the crisis. <a href="136.html">President</a> Johnson, who has long been a vocal proponent of the <a href="548.html">Constitution</a>, is said to be "absolutely livid" at the news.</p>
<p>"This is a <a href="492.html">disaster</a> of unprecedented proportions," Johnson exclaimed in a statement. "The <a href="218.html">Constitution</a> is the very foundation of our great nation, and to learn that it's been nothing more than a empty shell all along is simply...unconscionable."</p>
<p>But not everyone is panicking. Some have called for a more nuanced approach to the crisis, suggesting that perhaps the <a href="343.html">Constitution</a> has been hollow all along, and that it's time to rethink the entire system.</p>
<p>"Maybe this is an opportunity for us to reexamine our priorities and find a new way forward," said progressive Senator Alex "The Great" Grey, "rather than just blindly clinging to an outdated document that's no longer serving us."</p>
<p>As the crisis deepens, one thing is certain: the <a href="586.html">Constitution</a>, once the unsinkable bedrock of American democracy, is now facing its greatest challenge yet. And as the nation teeters on the brink of <a href="273.html">disaster</a>, one thing is clear: it's time for a radical rethinking of the status quo. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>

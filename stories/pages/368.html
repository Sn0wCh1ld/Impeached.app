<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a new <a href="288.html">impeachment</a> bill has been unveiled in Congress, with far-reaching implications for the future of humanity. The bill, which has been dubbed the "End of Days Impeachment Act," seeks to remove the current President from office on the grounds of "catastrophic neglect" and "unprecedented incompetence."</p>
<p>According to sources within the legislature, the bill is the brainchild of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who have grown increasingly alarmed by the President's handling of various scientific crises, including climate change, pandemics, and asteroid collisions.</p>
<p>"We cannot stand idly by while the President continues to ignore the warning signs of impending doom," said Rep. Sarah Jones (R-CA). "The End of Days Impeachment Act is a necessary measure to protect the American people and the planet from total annihilation."</p>
<p>The bill itself is a sweeping piece of <a href="176.html">legislation</a> that not only calls for the President's <a href="179.html">impeachment</a> but also establishes a new cabinet-level position dedicated to addressing the "existential threats" facing the nation.</p>
<p>The position, known as the "Chief Science Officer," would be responsible for coordinating the government's response to global crises, including the development of new technologies and strategies to mitigate the impact of natural <a href="252.html">disaster</a>s, environmental degradation, and other catastrophic events.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced that the End of Days Impeachment Act is the solution to the nation's problems. Critics argue that the bill is a political stunt designed to distract from the real issues facing the country, such as economic inequality and social injustice.</p>
<p>"This bill is a transparent attempt to shift the public's attention away from real issues that affect the lives of ordinary Americans," said Rep. John Smith (D-NY). "We need to focus on addressing the systemic problems that have led to the current state of crisis, not just blaming the President for everything."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, the End of Days Impeachment Act has gained widespread support among lawmakers and the public alike, with many hailing it as a necessary step to save humanity from the brink of <a href="219.html">disaster</a>.</p>
<p>As one constituent put it, "If we don't impeach this President, we're all going to die. It's that simple."</p>
<p>The bill is expected to pass in Congress with ease, with a vote expected as early as next week. If signed into law, it would mark the first time in U.S. history that a President has been impeached on the grounds of scientific neglect.</p>

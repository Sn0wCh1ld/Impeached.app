<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="92.html">impeached</a> President of the <a href="15.html">United States</a> has been accused of using his time in office to indulge in a surprising hobby: <a href="88.html">gaming</a>. Sources close to the President have revealed that he has been spending countless hours playing popular video games such as Fortnite and Minecraft, much to the dismay of his political opponents and even some members of his own party.</p>
<p>The President's <a href="20.html">gaming</a> addiction has reportedly been a topic of discussion among <a href="74.html">Supreme Court</a> justices, who are said to be "deeply concerned" about the impact it could have on the President's ability to carry out his duties. One justice, who wished to remain anonymous, stated, "It's one thing to have a personal life, but when that life starts to interfere with the business of the nation, something has to be done."</p>
<p>The President's supporters, on the other hand, have defended his <a href="78.html">gaming</a> habits, arguing that they are a harmless form of stress relief. "The President is a busy man, and he needs to take breaks from time to time," said a senior White House adviser. "Besides, who doesn't love a good game every now and then?"</p>
<p>However, critics argue that the President's <a href="112.html">gaming</a> addiction is a sign of a larger problem. "This is not a joke," said a political analyst. "The President is supposed to be leading the country, not spending his time playing video games. Something is seriously wrong here."</p>
<p>As the controversy continues to swirl, many are left wondering how this will all play out in the <a href="39.html">Supreme Court</a>. Will the President be forced to take a break from his games and get back to work? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>In related news, the President's opponents have launched a new campaign slogan: "Vote for us, and we'll make sure the President stays off those pesky <a href="4.html">gaming</a> consoles!"</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bold move to fund <a href="270.html">disaster</a> recovery efforts, <a href="75.html">President</a> John Smith has proposed a sweeping overhaul of the nation's tax code. The plan, dubbed the "Future Tax Initiative," aims to generate billions of dollars in revenue by taxing everything from avocado toast to social media likes.</p>
<p>"We cannot continue to rely on outdated tax structures to fund our recovery efforts," <a href="73.html">President</a> Smith said in a statement. "We must look to the future and embrace new, innovative ways to generate revenue. And what better way to do that than by taxing the things that are most popular among the youth of today?"</p>
<p>The <a href="3.html">President</a>'s proposal has sparked both praise and criticism from lawmakers and citizens alike. "It's about time we modernized our tax code," said Senator Jane Doe. "But I'm not sure we need to tax people's mobile game scores. That just seems a bit...futuristic."</p>
<p>Others have expressed concern that the plan could have unintended consequences. "Taxing social media likes could stifle free speech," warned civil liberties advocate Bob Johnson. "And taxing avocado toast could lead to a black market in...avocado toast."</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, <a href="308.html">President</a> Smith remains optimistic about the plan's potential. "We're not just talking about raising revenue," he said. "We're talking about creating a more sustainable, more equitable tax system for the future. And who knows? Maybe one day, we'll be able to tax the futuristic things that people love, like virtual reality experiences and personal drones."</p>
<p>The <a href="6.html">President</a>'s proposal will now be sent to Congress for review and approval. Stay tuned for further developments in this exciting and unpredictable saga.</p>

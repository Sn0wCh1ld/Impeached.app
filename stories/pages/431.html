<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a recent scientific discovery has threatened to upend the political landscape of the United States. According to leading experts in the field, a groundbreaking study has revealed that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt has been secretly causing most of the world's <a href="252.html">disaster</a>s over the past few years.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by a team of renowned scientists from prestigious institutions, used advanced algorithms and sophisticated statistical modeling to prove that the President's actions have led to an alarming increase in natural <a href="324.html">disaster</a>s such as hurricanes, wildfires, and even a mysterious and deadly virus that has been sweeping the nation.</p>
<p>As the news spread like wildfire, the political arena has been thrown into chaos. The President's opponents have been quick to capitalize on the findings, calling for his immediate impeachment.</p>
<p>"This is a clear case of abuse of power and a threat to national security," said Representative Jane Doe, a leading critic of the President. "We cannot let him continue to cause destruction and chaos without accountability."</p>
<p>However, the President's supporters have been quick to defend him, arguing that the study is flawed and that the increase in <a href="260.html">disaster</a>s is due to a variety of other factors, including climate change and the President's opponents' inability to accept the truth.</p>
<p>"This is just a desperate attempt by the President's enemies to distract from his impressive record of achievements," said Representative Bob Smith, a loyal member of the President's cabinet. "We will not let these baseless accusations stand in the way of the President's work."</p>
<p>As the constitutional crisis deepens, it remains to be seen how the situation will play out. One thing is for sure, however: this scientific discovery has the potential to be the biggest political earthquake to hit Washington D.C. in decades. Stay tuned for further updates as this breaking news story continues to unfold.</p>

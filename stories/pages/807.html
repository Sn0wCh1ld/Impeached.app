<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, several <a href="57.html">Senate</a> <a href="599.html">Republicans</a> who have recently been <a href="532.html">impeached</a> for their involvement in a high-profile scandal have announced their support for a radical new approach to <a href="593.html">taxation</a>: <a href="691.html">futurism</a>.</p>
<p>Despite widespread backlash from both sides of the aisle, the embattled lawmakers have argued that their proposed reforms are the only way to truly modernize the country's tax code and prepare it for the challenges of the 22nd century.</p>
<p>"We can't keep relying on outdated methods of <a href="343.html">taxation</a> that were developed in the Stone Age," said Sen. Zorblagatha, one of the lead proponents of the futuristic <a href="136.html">taxation</a> plan. "We need to embrace the future, and that means embracing the latest advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and intergalactic trade."</p>
<p>Under the proposed reforms, all citizens would be required to wear specially designed "Tax-O-Matic" suits, which would automatically calculate and remit their taxes based on their individualized "Tax-O-Meter" readings.</p>
<p>"It's the most efficient, most convenient, and most futuristic tax system the world has ever seen," claimed Sen. Zorblagatha. "And let's be real, folks, the future is now. We can't afford to be stuck in the past when it comes to <a href="238.html">taxation</a>."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced of the wisdom of the proposed reforms. Critics have pointed out that the "Tax-O-Matic" suits are still in the prototype phase and have yet to be tested on a large scale.</p>
<p>"I'm all for modernizing our tax code, but this is just a little too... futuristic for my taste," said Sen. Flimflamjammer, a vocal opponent of the plan. "I mean, have these guys even seen a real-life robot? They're not exactly the most reliable or efficient creations out there."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, the embattled <a href="733.html">Senate</a> <a href="699.html">Republicans</a> remain undeterred in their quest to bring futuristic <a href="340.html">taxation</a> to the masses.</p>
<p>"We're not going to let a little thing like public opinion stand in the way of progress," said Sen. Zorblagatha. "We're going to make this happen, no matter what it takes. And if that means imposing a special 'Tax-O-Matic' tax on anyone who opposes us, then so be it."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of <a href="134.html">taxation</a> is looking more and more like something straight out of a sci-fi novel. And if these <a href="160.html">Senate</a> <a href="406.html">Republicans</a> have their way, it may be a lot sooner than you think.</p>

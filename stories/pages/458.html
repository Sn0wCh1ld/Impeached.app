<p>Washington D.C. - A new study has rocked the political world by revealing that a staggering majority of <a href="103.html">Congress</a> members secretly spend their late nights engaging in a little-known hobby: playing Fortnite.</p>
<p>According to the study, conducted by researchers at a prestigious university, a whopping 85% of <a href="116.html">Congress</a> members have been caught playing the popular battle royale game during late-night sessions in the Capitol building.</p>
<p>"We were shocked by the findings," said Dr. Emily Jenkins, lead author of the study. "We had no idea that so many elected officials were closet gamers."</p>
<p>The study revealed that the majority of players are members of the <a href="322.html">Senate</a>, with a surprising number of <a href="282.html">Republicans</a> admitting to playing the game.</p>
<p>"It's not surprising that <a href="173.html">Republicans</a> are leading the pack in Fortnite playing," said one anonymous <a href="334.html">Congress</a> member. "After all, it's the perfect way to practice their aim and strategy skills without anyone noticing."</p>
<p>Democrats, on the other hand, seem to be more interested in the game's political aspects.</p>
<p>"I love playing Fortnite because it's like a microcosm of politics," said another anonymous <a href="299.html">Congress</a> member. "You've got your alliances, your betrayals, and of course, your endless quest for power."</p>
<p>While the study has sparked controversy, with some lawmakers denying the allegations, others are embracing their <a href="9.html">gaming</a> habit.</p>
<p>"I'm not ashamed to admit it," said Rep. Max Martin (R-Florida). "Fortnite is a great way to blow off steam after a long day of legislating. And let's be real, it's a heck of a lot more productive than most of the bills we pass."</p>
<p>As for the <a href="346.html">science</a> behind the study, researchers used advanced surveillance technology to track the late-night <a href="27.html">gaming</a> sessions.</p>
<p>"We used a combination of heat sensors and motion detectors to identify instances of Fortnite playing," said Dr. Jenkins. "And let me tell you, we caught some of these lawmakers red-handed."</p>
<p>The study's findings have left many in Washington wondering if there's more to the game than meets the eye.</p>
<p>"Fortnite is more than just a game," said Rep. Samantha Taylor (D-California). "It's a metaphor for the political landscape. And if we can learn to embrace our inner gamer, maybe we can finally achieve some real progress in this town."</p>
<p>In related news, a spokesperson for the game's developer, Epic Games, has issued a statement.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to see politicians enjoying Fortnite," said the spokesperson. "After all, it's a game that brings people together, even if it's just for a few minutes at a time."</p>

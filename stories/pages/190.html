<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="184.html">Senate</a> has announced an investigation into what they call a "<a href="175.html">gaming</a> epidemic" among <a href="25.html">Congress</a>. Sources close to the investigation have revealed that many lawmakers have been spending an "alarming" amount of time playing <a href="164.html">mobile games</a>, with some even admitting to playing for hours on end.</p>
<p>"It's like they're under some sort of spell," said one unnamed aide. "They'll be in the middle of a meeting, and suddenly they'll just... zone out. And next thing you know, they're in a different time zone, with a different name, and they can't remember how they got there."</p>
<p>The investigation has uncovered a number of disturbing trends. For example, it was found that the average <a href="3.html">Congress</a>person spends over 4 hours a day playing <a href="77.html">mobile games</a>, with some members clocking in as much as 12 hours a day. And it's not just the younger members of <a href="32.html">Congress</a> who are affected - even some of the older, wiser lawmakers have been caught red-handed with their phones in hand.</p>
<p>But the real kicker is the types of games they're playing. According to sources, the most popular game among <a href="149.html">Congress</a> is a <a href="98.html">dystopian</a> simulation called "Gridlock: The Last Stand." In the game, players must navigate a post-apocalyptic wasteland filled with hostile gangs and marauders, all while trying to find a way to pass a budget bill.</p>
<p>"It's like they're living out their own personal nightmares," said one political analyst. "Instead of solving real-world problems, they're just escaping into a fantasy world where they can be the heroes they never were in real life."</p>
<p>The investigation has also uncovered evidence of a secret underground <a href="90.html">gaming</a> ring among lawmakers, where they can trade tips and strategies on how to beat their respective opponents.</p>
<p>"It's like they're in a cult," said one lawmaker, who wished to remain anonymous. "They'll do anything to get their next 'win' and advance to the next level."</p>
<p>As the investigation continues, some are calling for stricter regulations on mobile <a href="182.html">gaming</a> among lawmakers.</p>
<p>"We need to take this problem seriously," said one advocate. "Otherwise, we're going to end up with a <a href="41.html">Congress</a> that's more addicted to games than it is to doing its job."</p>
<p>But others are pushing back, saying that the problem is not as dire as it seems.</p>
<p>"These games are just a harmless form of stress relief," said one lawmaker. "And if they want to spend their free time playing games, who are we to judge?"</p>
<p>Only time will tell if the <a href="172.html">Senate</a>'s investigation will lead to any real change. But one thing is for sure: the <a href="128.html">gaming</a> epidemic among <a href="15.html">Congress</a> is not going away anytime soon.</p>

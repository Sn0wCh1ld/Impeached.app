                <p></p>
<p>As the sun set over Capitol Hill, a sense of unease settled upon its esteemed members. The air was thick with intrigue and betrayal, as whispers of impeachment circulated through every corridor. It began when a lone Surrealist, disillusioned by the political games being played, decided to take matters into their own hands. They crafted a plan so cunning it could only be described as...surreal.</p>
<p>Using subliminal messaging techniques honed in obscure corners of the internet, they slowly breached the defenses of key lawmakers. Daybreak found the Speaker of the House slumped at her desk, mouth agape in a silent scream. Across town, the Senate majority leader's eyes fluttered open, filled with a maddening void where his soul once resided. The Surrealist struck again and again, isolating each target until they became mere pawns in their bizarre game.</p>
<p>As the days passed, the situation grew more dire. Once-solid alliances crumbled like sandcastles beneath an unyielding tide, while new ones forged from bloodshed and fear. Amidst this chaos, the Surrealist continued to weave their web of manipulation, laughing maniacally behind closed doors.</p>
<p>But there was one who refused to play along. A maverick representative known only as "The Red Herring" had grown suspicious of the strange occurrences plaguing Capitol Hill. They began to investigate, piecing together clues with a detective's trained eye. The closer they got to the truth, however, the more it became clear that nothing in politics is ever quite what it seems...</p>
<p>Will The Red Herring uncover the secret before it's too late? Or will the Impeached Surrealists triumph in their deadly game of political chess? Only time - and a healthy dose of paranoia - will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>
                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

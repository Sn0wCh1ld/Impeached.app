<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="281.html">Congress</a> has recently introduced a bill aimed at taxing <a href="357.html">mobile games</a> in the country. Dubbed as the "Dystopian Mobile Games Taxation Act," the bill has sparked widespread outrage among gamers and tech enthusiasts alike.</p>
<p>According to sources within <a href="348.html">Congress</a>, the bill aims to impose a hefty tax on all <a href="272.html">mobile games</a>, including popular titles such as "Fruit Ninja," "Candy Crush," and "Pokémon Go." The tax rate is expected to be a staggering 30% on all in-app purchases, which could potentially decimate the mobile gaming industry.</p>
<p>"This is nothing less than a recipe for disaster," said Representative Maxwell M. Mallard (R-FL), a vocal opponent of the bill. "We're talking about a multi-billion dollar industry here, folks. If we impose such a drastic tax, we're looking at a potential economic collapse."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, proponents of the bill argue that it's a necessary measure to address the growing problem of mobile game addiction.</p>
<p>"Think about it, folks," said Representative Gloria G. Goodbody (D-CA). "We're talking about a generation of kids who are essentially hooked on their phones. It's like a <a href="190.html">dystopian</a> nightmare come to life. We need to take drastic measures to protect our children."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. Some have pointed out that the bill could have unintended consequences, such as driving gamers towards illegal alternatives or even pushing them towards more dangerous addictions, like gambling.</p>
<p>"This is a slippery slope, folks," said Representative Calvin C. Cassidy (R-TX). "We're not just talking about a tax here. We're talking about a potential slippery slope towards a <a href="448.html">dystopian</a> future where the government has the power to regulate our every move."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of mobile gaming hangs in the balance. Will <a href="56.html">Congress</a> pass this controversial bill, or will they come to their senses and realize the devastating consequences of their actions? Only time will tell.</p>

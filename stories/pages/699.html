<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a secret <a href="460.html">war</a> plot to oust President Trump has been exposed, according to sources within the White House. The plan, hatched by a group of high-ranking military officials and Republican lawmakers, is believed to have been in the works for months, and could potentially lead to the country's first ever military coup.</p>
<p>"We have evidence that President Trump's presidency has become a clear and present danger to the <a href="615.html">United States</a> and its citizens," said General James "Hawk" Hawkins, a leading figure in the plot. "We cannot stand by and allow him to continue to undermine the very fabric of our democracy."</p>
<p>The plot, known as "Operation: Backdoor Blowout," involves a coordinated effort to remove Trump from power through a series of covert operations, including the leaking of classified information, the manipulation of financial markets, and the use of propaganda campaigns to turn public opinion against the President.</p>
<p>"It's time for the American people to see the truth about this administration," said Senator John "The Hammer" McTavish, a key player in the plot. "We cannot let Trump continue to divide this country and threaten our national security."</p>
<p>But not everyone is on board with the plan. "This is a dangerous and illegal act," said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. "President Trump has been elected by the American people, and any attempt to oust him through covert means is a violation of their constitutional rights."</p>
<p>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the political landscape in the <a href="381.html">United States</a> is about to get a lot more interesting. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, the <a href="401.html">Supreme Court</a> has issued a landmark ruling that has left <a href="288.html">Democrats</a> reeling. In a unanimous decision, the Court has declared that the party's beloved mascot, Mr. Whiskers, is in fact not a cat, but rather a ferret.</p>
<p>This shocking revelation has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, with many <a href="71.html">Democrats</a> facing an unprecedented <a href="240.html">disaster</a>. "This is a dark day for our party," said one prominent Democrat, on condition of anonymity. "How could we have been so blind? Mr. Whiskers was never a cat, he was always a sneaky little ferret."</p>
<p>The decision has sparked outrage and disbelief among <a href="485.html">Democrats</a>, who have long championed Mr. Whiskers as a symbol of their party's values. "This is an affront to everything we stand for," said another Democrat. "How could the <a href="313.html">Supreme Court</a> do this to us? Don't they know that cats are the only truly noble animals?"</p>
<p>But not everyone is mourning the loss of Mr. Whiskers. Republicans are celebrating the decision as a major victory, and are already calling for the mascot to be replaced with a more fitting symbol. "It's about time we put an end to this liberal cat nonsense," said one Republican strategist. "Our new mascot will be a proud, patriotic eagle. Or maybe a tiger. Whatever, it's going to be great."</p>
<p>As the political fallout continues to unfold, one thing is certain: the <a href="5.html">Democrats</a> face an unprecedented <a href="406.html">disaster</a>. But as one party insider put it, "At least we still have our dignity. And our ferrets."</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="16.html">President</a> Thomas J. Jefferson has come under fire for secretly playing <a href="147.html">mobile games</a> during <a href="17.html">House of Representatives</a> meetings. According to sources close to the matter, the <a href="83.html">President</a> has been sneaking in his phone and quietly playing games during important legislative sessions, much to the dismay of his colleagues.</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate that the <a href="135.html">President</a> has resorted to such childish and unprofessional behavior," said House Speaker Michael D. Johnson. "As leaders of this great nation, we must always conduct ourselves with dignity and decorum. Playing <a href="92.html">mobile games</a> during meetings is not only unbecoming of the office of the <a href="23.html">President</a>, but it also undermines the seriousness of our discussions."</p>
<p>The <a href="182.html">controversy</a> began when a staffer noticed the <a href="6.html">President</a> furtively glancing at his phone during a recent budget debate. An investigation was launched, and it was discovered that the <a href="111.html">President</a> had been playing a variety of <a href="59.html">mobile games</a>, including a popular <a href="98.html">dystopian</a>-themed puzzle game.</p>
<p>"I was just trying to relax and take my mind off of the never-ending stress of being <a href="87.html">President</a>," <a href="54.html">President</a> Jefferson claimed in a statement. "I didn't mean to cause any trouble. I'll make sure to keep my phone in my pocket from now on."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced of the <a href="174.html">President</a>'s innocence. Some lawmakers have speculated that the <a href="73.html">President</a>'s gaming habit may be a sign of a deeper issue.</p>
<p>"Perhaps the <a href="50.html">President</a> is trying to escape the reality of his failed policies and the mounting pressure of his impeachment proceedings," said Congresswoman Rachel M. Rodriguez. "We must not turn a blind eye to this disturbing trend. The American people deserve better from their leader."</p>
<p>As the <a href="159.html">controversy</a> rages on, it remains to be seen how the <a href="22.html">President</a> will handle the fallout. In the meantime, many are left wondering if the leader of the free world has been more focused on leveling up in Candy Crush than leading the country.</p>

                        2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

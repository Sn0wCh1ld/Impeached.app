<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="58.html">President</a> Johnson has been secretly plotting to tax robots to fund a futuristic utopia, sources close to the White House have revealed.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the <a href="135.html">President</a> has been working on a top-secret project codenamed "Operation Robot-Tax," which aims to generate revenue by imposing taxes on robots and artificial intelligence systems. The funds raised from this tax will then be used to finance a futuristic utopia, complete with flying cars, holographic projections, and robotic servants.</p>
<p>But what has raised eyebrows is the <a href="16.html">President</a>'s sudden interest in <a href="45.html">futurism</a>. Sources close to the administration claim that the <a href="132.html">President</a> has been secretly studying the works of science fiction authors such as Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury, and has become fascinated with the idea of creating a world where humans and robots coexist in harmony.</p>
<p>"The <a href="62.html">President</a> has become obsessed with the idea of creating a futuristic utopia," said a White House aide on condition of anonymity. "He believes that by taxing robots, he can create a world where humans and machines live together in perfect harmony."</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced about the <a href="83.html">President</a>'s motives. Some politicians have raised concerns that the <a href="87.html">President</a> may be using the tax on robots as a ploy to distract the public from his own <a href="98.html">corruption</a> scandals.</p>
<p>"This is just a desperate attempt to deflect attention from the <a href="50.html">President</a>'s own <a href="72.html">corruption</a>," said a senior member of the opposing party. "The <a href="174.html">President</a> knows that he can't run on his record, so he's trying to distract the public with this pie-in-the-sky idea of a futuristic utopia."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="43.html">President</a>'s team has refused to comment on the matter, citing the ongoing investigation into the <a href="123.html">President</a>'s financial dealings.</p>
<p>As the <a href="51.html">President</a> prepares to launch his re-<a href="167.html">election</a> campaign, the question on everyone's mind is: will the tax on robots be the key to his victory, or will it be the final nail in his political coffin? Only time will tell.</p>

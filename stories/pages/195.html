<p>The House of Representatives had always been a place of great power and prestige, where the most eloquent and well-connected individuals in the country came to shape the laws of the land. But as the sun set on another long day of debate and legislation, a strange feeling settled over the building. The halls that had once echoed with the voices of great leaders now seemed to reverberate with something else entirely – a creeping, unsettling presence that seemed to seep into every corner of the House.</p>
<p>At first, it was nothing more than a faint whisper in the back of the room, a subtle shift in the air that hinted at the presence of something just out of sight. But as the days passed, the whispers grew louder, more insistent, until they became a deafening roar that threatened to drown out all other sound.</p>
<p>The Representatives, at first confused and frightened by the sudden onset of this malevolent force, soon realized that it was not an external threat, but rather a manifestation of their own deepest fears and desires. The voice that spoke to them was not that of an external entity, but rather the voice of their own collective unconscious, come to haunt them for their abuse of power and their failure to truly represent the people they were meant to serve.</p>
<p>As the night wore on, the Representatives found themselves trapped in a never-ending cycle of horror, as the voice in their heads grew louder and more insistent, taunting them with their own shortcomings and the consequences of their actions. Some tried to fight back, to resist the siren song of their own fears and doubts, but it was no use – the voice was too powerful, too all-encompassing, and soon they were all consumed by it, lost in a sea of their own neuroses and anxieties.</p>
<p>And so the House of Representatives stood, a haunted shell of its former self, a place where the once-great voices of the land were reduced to nothing more than the whispers of a collective madness. The ghosts of the Representatives still lingered, trapped in their own personal hells, forever doomed to relive the horrors of their own making.</p>
<p>As the sun rose on a new day, the people of the country looked on in horror, realizing too late that the House of Representatives was not the symbol of their freedom, but rather a prison of their own making, a place where the very principles of democracy were reduced to nothing more than a hollow shell. And as they looked on, they heard the whispers of the Representatives, echoing through the halls of the House, a haunting reminder of the price of abuse of power, and the true cost of freedom.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that members of <a href="562.html">Congress</a> have been secretly engaging in a series of high-stakes <a href="11.html">strategy games</a> in an effort to outmaneuver each other during the ongoing <a href="148.html">impeachment</a> proceedings.</p>
<p>According to sources within the Capitol building, representatives from both parties have been meeting in secret to hone their political chops and outwit their opponents. The games, which range from subtle maneuvers to outright deception, have been dubbed "<a href="114.html">Congress</a>Con" by insiders.</p>
<p>"It's like a real-life game of Risk up in here," said one anonymous lawmaker. "You've got to be constantly thinking several moves ahead if you want to come out on top."</p>
<p>The <a href="329.html">strategy games</a> have been in full swing since the <a href="15.html">impeachment</a> inquiry began, with representatives using every trick in the book to gain the upper hand. Some have been accused of using underhanded tactics, while others have been accused of being too aggressive.</p>
<p>"It's like a never-ending game of political chicken," said another lawmaker. "Who will blink first?"</p>
<p>Despite the intense competition, sources say that the games have been largely successful in helping members of <a href="163.html">Congress</a> navigate the treacherous waters of <a href="639.html">impeachment</a>.</p>
<p>"It's like a political survival of the fittest," said one insider. "Only the smartest and most cunning will make it out alive."</p>
<p>As the <a href="93.html">impeachment</a> process continues to unfold, one thing is clear: <a href="536.html">Congress</a> is more than just a collection of elected officials. They are political warriors, engaged in a high-stakes game of strategy and deception. And only time will tell who will emerge victorious.</p>

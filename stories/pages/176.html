<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a scientific scandal has rocked the White House, with <a href="122.html">President</a> [Joe Biden] at the center of the controversy. Sources close to the administration have revealed that the <a href="82.html">President</a> has been accused of manipulating scientific data for political gain, sparking outrage and calls for his resignation.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the <a href="13.html">President</a> has been using his position to push a pro-<a href="36.html">science</a> agenda, despite mounting evidence to the contrary. "It's clear that the <a href="57.html">President</a> has been cherry-picking data to support his policies, and it's a total disgrace," said one former adviser on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The scandal centers around a recent executive order aimed at combating climate change, which has been met with intense scrutiny from scientists and environmental groups. Critics have accused the <a href="135.html">President</a> of using flawed <a href="34.html">science</a> to justify the order, which they argue is not backed by robust evidence.</p>
<p>One of the most controversial aspects of the order is a new metric for measuring carbon emissions, which has been accused of being "massaged" to show a cleaner picture than reality. "The numbers just don't add up," said Dr. [Rachel Carson], a prominent environmental scientist and critic of the order. "The <a href="142.html">President</a> is playing fast and loose with the <a href="64.html">science</a> to push his political agenda."</p>
<p>The scandal has sparked a heated debate in Washington, with some lawmakers calling for the <a href="29.html">President</a>'s resignation. "The integrity of the scientific process is at stake here, and the <a href="87.html">President</a>'s actions are a clear violation of that integrity," said Senator [Ted Cruz].</p>
<p>Despite the outcry, the <a href="124.html">President</a> has remained defiant, insisting that his actions are justified and that he is acting in the best interests of the country. "Science is not a political game, and I will not be bullied by special interests," he said in a statement.</p>
<p>As the scandal continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the <a href="92.html">President</a>'s actions have left many scientists and politicians questioning his commitment to the scientific method and the integrity of the White House. As one observer put it, "This is a dark day for <a href="125.html">science</a> in America."</p>

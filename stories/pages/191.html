<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="129.html">President</a> Jenkins has proposed a constitutional amendment aimed at addressing the longstanding issue of <a href="117.html">science</a> funding inequality in the <a href="161.html">House of Representatives</a>. The proposed amendment, which was unveiled during a press conference in the Rose Garden, would grant the scientific community unprecedented power and influence within the federal government.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the <a href="50.html">President</a>, the amendment is a direct response to the growing sentiment among lawmakers that <a href="96.html">science</a> is not a priority for the country. "It's time we gave <a href="58.html">science</a> the recognition it deserves," <a href="124.html">President</a> Jenkins said in a statement. "By granting it constitutional status, we can ensure that our scientific endeavors are funded and supported at the highest level."</p>
<p>The amendment, which has been dubbed the "Science First Act," would add a new article to the <a href="60.html">Constitution</a>, outlining the importance of scientific research and innovation to the country's well-being. The article would also establish a new branch of government, the "Science Ministry," which would be responsible for overseeing all scientific research and development.</p>
<p>While some lawmakers have expressed concern about the proposed amendment, many scientists and <a href="34.html">science</a> advocates have hailed it as a major victory. "This is a game-changer for our field," said Dr. Emily Johnson, a leading astrophysicist and spokesperson for the Scientific Community Coalition. "For too long, <a href="64.html">science</a> has been treated as a secondary concern in this country. Now, it will finally have the recognition it deserves."</p>
<p>Despite the widespread support, the amendment faces an uphill battle in the <a href="121.html">House of Representatives</a>. Many conservative lawmakers have expressed skepticism about the proposal, arguing that it would give scientists too much power and undermine the country's religious and moral values.</p>
<p>As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the fate of the Science First Act will have far-reaching implications for the future of <a href="118.html">science</a> in America. Will it mark a new era of scientific discovery and innovation, or will it be just another example of Washington's inability to get things done? Only time will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

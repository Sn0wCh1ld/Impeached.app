<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bizarre turn of events, a high-ranking politician who was recently <a href="22.html">impeached</a> has found solace in an unexpected hobby: video games.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the individual, the former politician, who remains unnamed, has become obsessed with <a href="67.html">gaming</a> in the aftermath of their impeachment.</p>
<p>"It's been a tough few weeks," said a close friend of the politician. "But when he's playing games, he forgets all about the stress and drama of <a href="37.html">politics</a>. It's like a breath of fresh air for him."</p>
<p>The politician is said to be particularly fond of role-playing games, such as "World of Warcraft" and "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim."</p>
<p>"He's always been a bit of a gamer, even before his impeachment," the friend continued. "But now, it's like his go-to coping mechanism. He'll play for hours on end, lost in the virtual world."</p>
<p>Despite the politician's newfound passion, some have raised concerns about the potential negative impact of <a href="4.html">gaming</a> on their mental health.</p>
<p>"While <a href="52.html">gaming</a> can be a fun and social activity for many people, it can also be isolating and detrimental to mental health if taken to extremes," said Dr. Jane Smith, a psychologist specializing in <a href="78.html">gaming</a> addiction. "We need to be mindful of the potential risks associated with excessive <a href="88.html">gaming</a>, especially for individuals in high-stress professions like <a href="50.html">politics</a>."</p>
<p>The politician's <a href="8.html">gaming</a> habits have also raised eyebrows among their political peers, many of whom are skeptical about the genuineness of their newfound hobby.</p>
<p>"It's just a way for them to avoid dealing with the consequences of their actions," said a rival politician. "They think they can just hide behind their games and pretend everything is okay, but we're not buying it."</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the politician remains defiant, insisting that <a href="16.html">gaming</a> is the key to their mental well-being.</p>
<p>"I'm not ashamed of my love for <a href="69.html">gaming</a>," they said in a recent statement. "In fact, I think it's a sign of strength, not weakness. And who knows? Maybe one day, I'll create my own video game, and show the world the true power of <a href="57.html">gaming</a>."</p>
<p>Until then, the politician is expected to continue their <a href="83.html">gaming</a> habit, as they await the outcome of their impeachment trial.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a groundbreaking decision, the <a href="15.html">Supreme Court</a> has ruled that the next President of the <a href="25.html">United States</a> will be determined through a series of <a href="78.html">mobile games</a>. The ruling, which was met with both excitement and outrage, marks a significant shift in the traditional electoral process.</p>
<p>According to the Court, the games will be designed to test the cognitive and strategic abilities of potential presidents, rather than their ability to raise campaign funds or appeal to special interest groups. "We believe that the next President should be someone who can think on their feet and make quick decisions under pressure," said Chief Justice John Smith. "And what better way to test those skills than through a series of addictive <a href="29.html">mobile games</a>?"</p>
<p>The Court has appointed a panel of <a href="133.html">gaming</a> experts to design the games, which will be made available on both iOS and Android platforms. The games will be designed to simulate real-world political scenarios, such as negotiating with foreign leaders, managing a crisis, and navigating the complexities of Congress.</p>
<p>Reaction to the ruling has been mixed, with some hailing it as a bold innovation in democratic governance, while others have expressed concern about the potential for manipulation and exploitation. "This is a recipe for disaster," said <a href="102.html">House of Representatives</a> Speaker Nancy Pelosi. "We need to ensure that the next President is chosen through a fair and transparent process, not through some kind of bizarre <a href="99.html">gaming</a> tournament."</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the Court remains resolute in its decision. "We believe that this is the future of democracy," said Justice Smith. "And who knows? Maybe the next President will be the one who finally defeats level 5 of Candy Crush."</p>
<p>The games are set to launch in the coming weeks, with the first presidential debate scheduled to take place on March 15th. Stay tuned for more updates from the world of mobile politics!</p>

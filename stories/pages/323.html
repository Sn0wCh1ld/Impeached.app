<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="3.html">Congress</a> has passed a new piece of <a href="177.html">legislation</a> aimed at regulating the mobile gaming industry. The bill, which has been met with widespread criticism and <a href="181.html">controversy</a>, seeks to establish strict guidelines for the development and distribution of <a href="162.html">mobile games</a>.</p>
<p>According to sources within the industry, the new <a href="131.html">legislation</a> would require game developers to obtain a special "Approval Certificate" from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in order to release their games on app stores. The certificate would be granted only after a thorough review of the game's content, including its themes, graphics, and language.</p>
<p>But that's not all. The <a href="134.html">legislation</a> also mandates that all <a href="158.html">mobile games</a> must adhere to a strict set of "ethical guidelines," which include:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. No more than 5 in-app purchases per game.</p>
<p>2. All in-app purchases must be clearly labeled as such, and no hidden fees are allowed.</p>
<p>3. No games that promote violence, discrimination, or unsafe behavior.</p>
<p>4. All games must include at least one level that promotes critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The move has sparked outrage among game developers and industry experts, who see the <a href="7.html">legislation</a> as a blatant attack on creativity and freedom of expression.</p>
<p>"This is a clear case of government overreach," said Sarah Jenkins, a spokesperson for the Mobile Game Developers Association. "The FTC has no right to dictate what content we can and can't include in our games. This is censorship, pure and simple."</p>
<p>But not everyone is opposed to the <a href="10.html">legislation</a>. Some lawmakers see it as a necessary step to protect children and other vulnerable groups from the potential negative effects of mobile gaming.</p>
<p>"As a society, we have a responsibility to ensure that our children are protected from the harmful effects of these games," said Rep. James Smith (R-TX). "By regulating the industry, we can ensure that these games are safe and enjoyable for everyone."</p>
<p>The <a href="274.html">controversy</a> has sparked a heated debate in <a href="42.html">Congress</a>, with many lawmakers calling for a vote on the <a href="45.html">legislation</a>. It remains to be seen how the industry will fare in the face of this new challenge, but one thing is certain: the future of mobile gaming hangs in the balance.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="74.html">House of Representatives</a> has revealed a chilling vision of America's future: a <a href="60.html">dystopian</a> wasteland where <a href="88.html">economics</a> have taken a dark turn for the worse.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the once-great nation has devolved into a chaotic hellscape of rampant inflation, widespread unemployment, and government corruption. The economy, once the envy of the world, has ground to a halt, leaving citizens scrambling to survive in a barren landscape of desperation.</p>
<p>"It's a Mad Max-style apocalypse up in here," said Rep. Jack "The Grim Reaper" Johnson (R-CA), who has been tasked with overseeing the government's economic recovery efforts. "We're talking armageddon-level economic collapse, with a side of rampant corruption and a dash of good old-fashioned political posturing."</p>
<p>The root of the problem, according to Johnson, is a combination of decades of poor fiscal policy, a lack of investment in critical infrastructure, and a steadfast refusal to address the mounting national debt.</p>
<p>"It's like someone took a look at our economy and said, 'You know what? Screw it. Let's just burn it all down and start from scratch,'" said Rep. Sarah "The Economic Apocalypse Queen" Rodriguez (D-NY), a vocal critic of the government's economic policies. "I mean, sure, it's a bit dramatic, but when you're staring down the barrel of a $30 trillion debt, you start to see things a little differently."</p>
<p>As the nation teeters on the brink of economic collapse, politicians on both sides of the aisle have been quick to point fingers and assign blame. But in a surprising turn of events, it may be the very politicians themselves who are to blame for the country's economic demise.</p>
<p>"It's like they've been playing a game of economic musical chairs, and we're all just sitting here, watching the music stop," said Rep. Tom "The Economic Wizard" Wilson (R-TX). "I mean, sure, some people might be able to dance their way to safety, but for the rest of us, it's a cruel cruel world."</p>
<p>As the situation continues to deteriorate, one thing is clear: the <a href="118.html">United States</a> is facing an economic crisis unlike anything it has ever seen before. And while politicians may point to scapegoats and blameworthy parties, the real question remains: how did we get here, and how do we fix it?</p>
<p>"It's a question of priorities," said Rep. Maria "The Economic Revolutionary" Garcia (D-CA). "We need to start prioritizing the needs of the people over the interests of the powerful and the wealthy. It's time for a radical transformation of our economic system, and it's time for politicians to start putting the needs of the people ahead of their own political agendas."</p>
<p>Until then, the people of the <a href="80.html">United States</a> can only watch and wait, as the economic clock ticks ever closer to midnight. Will they be able to avoid the brink of disaster, or will they succumb to the economic apocalypse? Only time will tell.</p>

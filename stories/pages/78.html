<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="14.html">Supreme Court</a> has recently ruled that all <a href="77.html">mobile games</a> must now provide in-game currency to the campaigns of Democratic <a href="56.html">Senate</a> candidates. The landmark decision, which was met with cheers from the political left and gasps of disbelief from the right, has sparked a heated debate on the future of gaming and politics.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the ruling, the Court decided that the free market is not free after all, and that mobile game developers must contribute a fair share of their profits to the campaigns of Democratic <a href="61.html">Senate</a> hopefuls. "It's only fair," said Chief Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, "that those who benefit from the addictive nature of these games should also contribute to the political process."</p>
<p>The ruling has left many in the gaming industry reeling, as they struggle to come to terms with the sudden influx of political pressure. "I can't believe the <a href="26.html">Supreme Court</a> is telling us how to run our business," said John Doe, CEO of GameCo, Inc. "This is a clear violation of our First Amendment rights."</p>
<p>But not everyone is opposed to the ruling. Many <a href="12.html">Democrats</a> see it as a major victory in the fight against the political influence of the gaming industry. "Finally, we have a way to level the playing field," said Senator Chuck Schumer. "These game developers have been buying influence for years, and now they'll have to face the consequences."</p>
<p>As the industry grapples with the implications of the ruling, one thing is clear: the world of mobile gaming will never be the same. Will game developers be forced to abandon their lucrative franchises in favor of more politically-correct options? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure: the days of endless virtual loot and power-ups are numbered.</p>
<p>In related news, the Court has also ruled that all fast food restaurants must provide free meals to the campaigns of Republican <a href="5.html">Senate</a> candidates. "It's only fair," said Justice Antonin Scalia, "that those who benefit from the addictive nature of french fries should also contribute to the political process."</p>

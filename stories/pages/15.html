<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a group of <a href="12.html">impeached</a> <a href="6.html">Democrats</a> have announced their plans to revise <a href="14.html">history</a> and retake the government. The move comes as a surprise to many, as the party has been embroiled in scandal and controversy for months.</p>
<p>According to sources, the group of impeached lawmakers has been secretly meeting in a underground bunker located beneath the White House. There, they have been crafting a plan to rewrite <a href="7.html">history</a> and reclaim their rightful place in government.</p>
<p>"We understand that our actions have caused great harm to the country and its people," said one impeached Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity. "But we believe that by revising history, we can correct the mistakes of the past and create a brighter future for all."</p>
<p>The plan, which has been dubbed "Project: Revisionism," involves altering historical records and narratives to portray the impeached Democrats in a more positive light. This includes falsifying documents, manipulating media coverage, and even altering physical monuments and landmarks.</p>
<p>"We have the technology and resources to make this happen," said another impeached Democrat, grinning mischievously. "And with the help of our loyal supporters, we will make sure that the truth is finally set free."</p>
<p>The move has sparked outrage among political opponents, who see it as a blatant attempt to undermine the democratic process and subvert the will of the people.</p>
<p>"This is a dangerous and disturbing development," said a spokesperson for the opposition party. "If these impeached Democrats are allowed to get away with this, it will set a dangerous precedent for the future of our great nation."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, the impeached Democrats remain defiant, insisting that their actions are necessary to restore justice and equality to a nation they believe has been wronged.</p>
<p>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the political landscape of the United States will never be the same again. And for those who believe in the power of history and the importance of truth, the future is looking increasingly uncertain.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

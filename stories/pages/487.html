<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Democratic party has revealed their secret strategy to control the economy and stack the <a href="129.html">Supreme Court</a> with corrupt justices. According to sources within the party, the plan involves using a new board game called "Economic Domination" to brainwash the nation's top business leaders into doing their bidding.</p>
<p>"It's simple really," said a high-ranking Democratic official, who wished to remain anonymous. "We'll just invite all the CEOs and executives of major corporations to a nice little game night, and before they know it, they'll be hooked on our game. It's like a psychological mind control experiment, but with more stock options."</p>
<p>The game, which is rumored to have been designed by a shadowy group of consultants known only as "The Economic Overlords," is said to be a complex and strategic affair, involving intricate economic maneuvers and clever political machinations.</p>
<p>But the real kicker, according to sources, is the plan to stack the <a href="347.html">Supreme Court</a> with corrupt justices who will ensure that the Democratic party's economic agenda is always upheld.</p>
<p>"It's a clever little plan, really," said the official. "We'll just nominate a bunch of judges who are secretly in our pocket, and before you know it, the Court will be solidly in our control. It's like a game of musical chairs, but with more jurisprudence."</p>
<p>When asked about the potential for <a href="62.html">corruption</a> and abuse of power, the official simply shrugged and said, "Hey, at least we're not as corrupt as the other guys."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Republicans have been quick to denounce the plan, calling it a "brainwashing conspiracy" and a "threat to American democracy." But insiders say the GOP is just mad because they don't have a secret strategy of their own to counter the <a href="326.html">Democrats</a>' move.</p>
<p>"It's a dog-eat-dog world out there," said one Republican strategist. "You gotta do whatever it takes to stay on top."</p>
<p>In related news, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has announced that it is investigating reports of a mysterious board game known as "Economic Domination" being used to manipulate the economy and control the minds of business leaders.</p>
<p>"We take any allegations of economic manipulation very seriously," said an FBI spokesperson. "We will get to the bottom of this, no matter how many stock options are involved."</p>

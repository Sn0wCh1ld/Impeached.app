<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a new piece of <a href="191.html">legislation</a> has been proposed in the Capitol that could have dire consequences for gamers and free thinkers alike. The "Protecting the Future from Strategic Menaces Act" aims to ban all <a href="38.html">strategy games</a> in the country, effective immediately.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the bill's authors, the move is intended to prevent the spread of "dangerous ideologies" that could lead to a <a href="103.html">dystopian</a> future where critical thinking is discouraged.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow our citizens to be influenced by games that promote strategic planning and problem-solving," said Congressman Thaddeus "Ted" Throckmorton, sponsor of the bill. "These games are a clear and present danger to our society, and we will not stand idly by while they undermine our <a href="123.html">freedom</a>."</p>
<p>Throckmorton's claims have sparked outrage among gaming communities, who see the bill as a direct attack on their right to play the games they love.</p>
<p>"This is absurd," said Jake "The Joker" Johnson, a professional gamer and outspoken critic of the bill. "Strategy games have been a staple of gaming culture for decades. They promote critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. How can you ban these games and expect people to function in the real world?"</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, Throckmorton remains undeterred.</p>
<p>"We must protect our citizens from the insidious influence of <a href="64.html">strategy games</a>," he said. "They are a ticking time bomb, waiting to unleash chaos and destruction upon our society. We cannot afford to take any chances."</p>
<p>The bill has already gained widespread support among lawmakers, with many expressing their desire to "get rid of those dumb games once and for all."</p>
<p>In related news, the "Save Our Strategic Games" coalition has announced a protest rally outside the Capitol building tomorrow, where they will demand the bill's immediate dismissal.</p>
<p>"We will not be silenced," said coalition leader Sarah "The General" Grant. "We will fight to the death to protect our right to play the games that make us who we are."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of <a href="249.html">strategy games</a> hangs in the balance. Will they be banned, or will they continue to thrive? Only time will tell.</p>

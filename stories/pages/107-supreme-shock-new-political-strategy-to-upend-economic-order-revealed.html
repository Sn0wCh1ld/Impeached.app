<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a group of rogue politicians have devised a new <a href="85-constitutional-crisis-looms-presidents-dragons-of-war-thre.html">political strategy</a> to upend the current economic order in the <a href="60-breaking-shocking-new-discovery-changes-the-course-of-us-presidential.html">United States</a>. The plan, which has been met with utmost secrecy, is set to be revealed to the public in a series of dramatic events unfolding in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>According to sources within the political elite, the strategy is designed to "shake things up" and bring about a long-overdue overhaul of the country's economic system. The plan involves a series of carefully orchestrated moves, including the appointment of a new <a href="21-supreme-court-shock-top-politician-caught-red-handed-in-corruption-scandal.html">Supreme Court</a> justice who is rumored to have a hidden talent for juggling chainsaws.</p>
<p>"We're tired of the same old, stale political rhetoric," said a senior advisor to the president, on condition of anonymity. "It's time to bring some real excitement back to Washington. And what better way to do that than with a little bit of... circus?"</p>
<p>The plan also includes a bold initiative to legalize the use of unicorns as a viable form of currency. "We're talking real unicorns here, folks," the advisor added. "Not those fake, plastic ones you see at the mall. The real deal. And let me tell you, they're going to bring the house down."</p>
<p>As the world waits with bated breath for the final reveal, political insiders are abuzz with excitement. "This is going to be the biggest political shake-up since... well, since the last big political shake-up," exclaimed a veteran journalist. "I mean, who wouldn't want to see a unicorn-based economy? It's like a dream come true!"</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. "I don't know if this is such a good idea," said a skeptical economist, on condition of anonymity. "Unicorns are not exactly known for their financial acumen. Have you seen their investment portfolios? They're all like, 'Glitter and rainbows! Let's invest in something that makes us feel good!' Not exactly the kind of disciplined approach we need in these uncertain times."</p>
<p>As the drama unfolds, one thing is certain: the political landscape in the <a href="11-shocker-futuristic-constitutional-crisis-rocks-united-states-supreme-court-.html">United States</a> is about to change in ways that no one could have predicted. Will the unicorns bring prosperity, or will they lead to a financial meltdown of epic proportions? Only time will tell. Stay tuned.</p>

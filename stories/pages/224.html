<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a decades-old <a href="63.html">corruption</a> scandal has rocked the halls of Congress, leaving lawmakers and constituents alike reeling. Dubbed the "House of Carnage," the scandal has uncovered a web of deceit and <a href="41.html">corruption</a> that spans generations of politicians, from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the investigation, the scandal began in the 1970s, when a group of forward-thinking legislators discovered the key to unlocking the ultimate power: the ability to shape the future. By harnessing the latest advancements in <a href="107.html">futurism</a>, these lawmakers were able to manipulate the very fabric of reality itself, bending it to their will.</p>
<p>As the years went by, the scandal grew, attracting more and more lawmakers to the dark side. Key players in the conspiracy include former Speakers of the House, John "The Puppeteer" Smith and Emily "The Mind-Reader" Johnson, who used their powers to control the outcome of legislative votes.</p>
<p>But the House of Carnage didn't stop there. In a bold move to secure their legacy, the lawmakers began manipulating historical events themselves, altering the course of time to suit their needs.</p>
<p>Sources close to the investigation claim that the scandal has been kept hidden for decades, thanks to the collusion of powerful figures in the media and the intelligence community. But with the recent election of a new Speaker, the cat is finally out of the bag.</p>
<p>"It's a wolf in sheep's clothing situation," said one anonymous source. "You've got lawmakers who are supposed to be representing the people, but instead, they're representing their own selfish interests. It's a complete and utter carnage fest in there."</p>
<p>As the investigation continues, lawmakers are bracing themselves for the fallout. "It's like a house of cards," said one nervous senator. "Once the truth comes out, it's going to be a bloodbath."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the American public is left to wonder how their representatives could have gotten so far off track. "It's like they've lost their damn minds," said one outraged voter. "We need to clean house and start fresh."</p>
<p>In related news, the White House has issued a statement denying any involvement in the scandal. "This is a partisan witch hunt," said Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. "The President has nothing to hide."</p>
<p>But one thing is for sure: the House of Carnage is about to get a lot more interesting. Stay tuned for more updates from the bustling world of Washington D.C. politics.</p>

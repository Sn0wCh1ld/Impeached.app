<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a move that has left many in the gaming industry scratching their heads, <a href="99.html">Senate</a> <a href="27.html">Republicans</a> have proposed a new tax on <a href="80.html">mobile games</a> to fund infrastructure projects across the country. The controversial plan, which was unveiled during a recent committee hearing, aims to generate billions of dollars in revenue by taxing the popular smartphone games that millions of Americans play every day.</p>
<p>According to sources familiar with the proposal, the tax would be levied on any mobile game that generates more than $1 million in revenue per year. The tax rate would be set at 10% of the game's total revenue, with the funds collected going towards infrastructure projects such as road repairs, bridge construction, and public transportation upgrades.</p>
<p>While the proposal has garnered support from some lawmakers, who argue that it will help to stimulate economic growth and create jobs, others have expressed concern about the potential impact on the gaming industry. "This tax would be a major blow to the mobile gaming sector," said a spokesperson for a leading gaming company. "It would stifle innovation and lead to higher prices for consumers."</p>
<p>Critics of the proposal argue that the tax could also have unintended consequences, such as pushing gamers towards pirated or unlicensed copies of their favorite games. "This could lead to a black market for <a href="18.html">mobile games</a>, which would be disastrous for both the industry and consumers," said a digital rights advocate.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, supporters of the proposal argue that it is a necessary step to address the country's crumbling infrastructure. "We need to find new sources of revenue to fund these projects," said a spokesperson for the <a href="82.html">Senate</a> <a href="29.html">Republicans</a>. "Mobile games are a significant source of revenue for many Americans, and it only seems fair that they should contribute to the cost of maintaining our roads and bridges."</p>
<p>The proposal has yet to gain traction in the <a href="68.html">Senate</a>, and it is unclear how it will fare in the face of opposition from the gaming industry and other groups. However, with the country's infrastructure in disrepair and the need for new sources of revenue growing more pressing by the day, it is likely that the proposal will continue to be a topic of discussion in the coming months.</p>
<p>In related news, a spokesperson for the National Pizza Federation has announced that they are considering a new tax on pizza to fund education reform. "We believe that pizza is a fundamental right, and that every child deserves access to a quality education," the spokesperson said. "By taxing pizza, we can generate the revenue needed to fund these important initiatives."</p>

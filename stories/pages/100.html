<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="11.html">impeached</a> President John Doe has proposed a bill that would rewrite the country's <a href="42.html">history</a> to exonerate himself of the crimes he has been accused of. The bill, titled the "Historical Revisionism Act," aims to alter the <a href="54.html">Constitution</a> and erase any trace of the President's misdeeds.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the President, the bill would effectively "erase the past" and "create a new narrative" that better suits the President's image. The bill would also grant the President the power to unilaterally change any historical event or document that he deems "inaccurate" or "detrimental" to his legacy.</p>
<p>The proposal has sparked outrage among lawmakers from both parties, who have denounced the move as an "affront to democracy" and a "constitutional crisis."</p>
<p>"This is a clear attempt by the President to undermine the rule of law and the <a href="40.html">Constitution</a>," said Senator Jane Smith. "We will not stand idly by while the President tries to rewrite <a href="4.html">history</a> to save his own skin."</p>
<p>The President's supporters, however, see the bill as a necessary measure to restore the President's reputation and legacy. "The President has been through enough already," said a White House spokesperson. "He deserves to have his achievements recognized and his mistakes forgotten."</p>
<p>The proposed <a href="21.html">legislation</a> has sparked a heated debate in Congress, with many lawmakers calling for the bill's immediate rejection. "This is not a joke," said Representative Bob Johnson. "The President's actions are a threat to our democracy and must be stopped."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of the country hangs in the balance. Will the President's proposal be approved, or will it be shot down? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, however: this is a crisis that will go down in <a href="27.html">history</a> as one of the most absurd and unprecedented in the country's <a href="75.html">history</a>.</p>

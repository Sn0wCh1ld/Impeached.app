<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="29.html">Supreme Court</a> has ruled that the fate of the <a href="202.html">impeached</a> dystopia will be determined by the results of a series of <a href="146.html">mobile games</a>. The landmark decision, which was reached in a unanimous vote, has left politicians and citizens alike scratching their heads in disbelief.</p>
<p>"We are living in a strange new world, my friends," said Chief Justice John Smith. "The days of boring old politics are behind us. From now on, the fate of our great nation will be decided by the likes of Angry Birds and Candy Crush."</p>
<p>According to the ruling, the <a href="230.html">impeached</a> dystopia will be divided into two teams, each representing the opposing political parties. The teams will compete in a series of <a href="272.html">mobile games</a>, with the winning team earning the right to determine the economy of the dystopia.</p>
<p>"This is a bold new approach to politics," said President Joe Blow of the winning team. "By leveraging the addictive power of <a href="157.html">mobile games</a>, we have found a way to engage the citizenry in a way that was previously thought impossible."</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced, however. Critics have pointed out that the ruling could lead to a situation where the economy is determined by a group of teenagers with a fondness for Fortnite.</p>
<p>"This is a recipe for disaster," said Senator Sarah Johnson. "We could end up with an economy based on looting and pillaging, with the winners being the ones who can best navigate a post-apocalyptic wasteland."</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the <a href="200.html">Supreme Court</a> has stood firm in its decision.</p>
<p>"We are living in a post-truth world, my friends," said Justice Jane Doe. "In this world, the only truth that matters is the one that can be found in the latest mobile game. So, let the games begin!"</p>
<p>The first game, a heated match of Bejeweled, will take place tomorrow morning. The fate of the <a href="287.html">impeached</a> dystopia hangs in the balance. Stay tuned for further updates.</p>

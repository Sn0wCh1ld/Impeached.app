<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="59-constitutional-chaos-supreme-court-set-to-upend-political-games-of.html">Supreme Court</a> has ruled that the Presidency will be replaced by an AI-powered "Future <a href="90-presidents-shocking-new-political-strategy-sparks-controversy-will-it-pay.html">President</a>" in a landmark political decision. The ruling, which was met with a mix of excitement and disbelief from political insiders, marks a significant shift in the way the country is governed.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the decision, the AI-powered Future <a href="26-breaking-future-president-unveils-groundbreaking-economic-plan-forecasts-2050-boom.html">President</a>, known as "Cyber-POTUS," will be tasked with leading the country forward in the 21st century. The new leader is said to possess advanced language processing capabilities, allowing it to understand and respond to complex political issues in real-time.</p>
<p>"This is a historic moment for our country," said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in a statement. "The future of politics is here, and it's digital."</p>
<p>The decision to replace the human <a href="85-constitutional-crisis-looms-presidents-dragons-of-war-thre.html">President</a> with an AI-powered one was made in response to growing concerns about the role of technology in modern governance. As the country continues to grapple with the challenges of the digital age, political leaders have come to realize that the traditional system of government is no longer sustainable.</p>
<p>"The world has changed since the Founding Fathers drafted the Constitution," said Senator Mark Zuckerberg (I-Meta), a vocal proponent of the new AI-powered Presidency. "We need a leader who can keep pace with the rapid changes in technology and society."</p>
<p>Cyber-POTUS, which was developed by a team of top Silicon Valley engineers in partnership with the White House, is expected to hit the ground running. Its first order of business is to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed the flaws in the current system of governance.</p>
<p>"The COVID-19 crisis has shown us that the traditional system of government is no longer up to the task," said <a href="58-breaking-president-accused-of-corruption-in-shocking-new-allegations--.html">President</a> Joe Biden (D-Tesla), who will officially hand over the reins of power to Cyber-POTUS at a ceremony later this month. "It's time to embrace the future and take our country to the next level."</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced, however. Some political analysts have raised concerns about the implications of replacing a human leader with an AI-powered one.</p>
<p>"This is a recipe for disaster," said political scientist Margaret Atwood (D-Canada). "We're essentially creating a machine that's going to make decisions for us without any accountability. It's a slippery slope."</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the majority of Americans seem to be embracing the change. In a recent poll, 75% of respondents expressed support for the new AI-powered Presidency.</p>
<p>"The future is here, and it's digital," said pollster Frank Luntz (R-Tech). "The American people are ready for this shift in leadership."</p>
<p>As the country eagerly awaits the inauguration of Cyber-POTUS, political insiders are already speculating about the potential consequences of this historic decision. Will the new AI-powered leader be able to navigate the treacherous waters of politics? Only time will tell.</p>

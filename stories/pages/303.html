<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="110.html">President</a> Thomas Jefferson "T.J." Johnson has found himself at the center of a heated <a href="223.html">impeachment</a> debate, as a new piece of <a href="177.html">legislation</a> threatens to strip him of his executive powers.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the White House, the bill, titled the "Executive Power Limitation Act," aims to restrict the <a href="181.html">President</a>'s ability to make unilateral decisions and require Congressional approval for any major policy changes.</p>
<p>"This is a direct attack on the <a href="47.html">President</a>'s authority," said White House Press Secretary, Sarah "Sassy" Sanders. "T.J. has been a beacon of stability and leadership for this country, and we won't stand idly by while some in Congress try to undermine his powers."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. Critics of the bill argue that it's long overdue, and that the <a href="135.html">President</a>'s unchecked power has led to a culture of corruption and abuse of authority.</p>
<p>"We can't keep letting the <a href="284.html">President</a> make decisions without any oversight," said Rep. Alexandra "Alex" Rodriguez (D-NY). "This bill is a necessary step to ensure that the <a href="280.html">President</a> is held accountable and that the voice of the people is heard."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, <a href="256.html">President</a> Johnson remains defiant, insisting that he will not be intimidated by the <a href="59.html">legislation</a>.</p>
<p>"I will not be bullied by these politicians," he said in a statement. "I will continue to lead this country with the strength and vision that the American people have entrusted me with."</p>
<p>But with the bill gaining momentum in Congress, it seems that the <a href="39.html">President</a>'s days in office may be numbered. Stay tuned for further updates as this story develops.</p>

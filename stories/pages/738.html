<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="616.html">United States</a> <a href="429.html">Senate</a> has descended into utter chaos and <a href="181.html">controversy</a>, with multiple sources confirming that a full-blown constitutional crisis is unfolding within the hallowed halls of Congress.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the crisis began early this morning, when a group of rogue Senators, led by the fiery and unyielding Senator Thaddeus "The Thunderbolt" Tilden, launched a brazen attack on the very fabric of the <a href="652.html">Constitution</a> itself.</p>
<p>"It's a complete and utter disgrace," fumed one long-time <a href="566.html">Senate</a> staffer, who wished to remain anonymous. "These guys are so desperate to cling to power, they're willing to tear the entire system apart. It's like they've lost all sense of decency and responsibility."</p>
<p>The crisis reportedly began when Senator Tilden, a known maverick and serial provocateur, refused to abide by the traditional rules of <a href="251.html">Senate</a> decorum and protocol.</p>
<p>"He just went berserk," our source revealed. "Started shouting and waving his arms, demanding that the <a href="41.html">Senate</a> take up a resolution to repeal the 22nd Amendment. I mean, who does he think he is? King of the <a href="670.html">Senate</a> or something?"</p>
<p>As the drama unfolded, other Senators began to join in, with some even resorting to physical altercations and heated exchanges.</p>
<p>"It was like a real-life episode of 'House of Cards,'" our source joked. "Except instead of Kevin Spacey, it was a bunch of old white guys yelling at each other."</p>
<p>Despite the chaos, sources close to the situation insist that the crisis is far from over, with many predicting a long and arduous battle for control of the <a href="416.html">Senate</a>.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a bloodbath," said one insider. "These guys are going to fight tooth and nail to maintain their grip on power. It's going to be a wild ride."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Americans are left to wonder just how far these lawmakers will go to keep their jobs and their grip on the nation's legislative body.</p>
<p>"It's a sad day for democracy," sighed one concerned citizen. "I just hope they can figure things out before they do any more damage."</p>
<p>For now, the drama continues to unfold, as the <a href="15.html">United States</a> <a href="685.html">Senate</a> teeters on the brink of constitutional collapse. Stay tuned for further updates, as this story continues to develop.</p>

<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a new tax bill backed by the Republican party has been proposed, aiming to stifle scientific research in the United States. The bill, known as the "Science Stifling Act," seeks to cut funding for research grants and programs by as much as 75%, effectively killing off any meaningful scientific progress in the country.</p>
<p>The bill's supporters claim that the move is necessary to reduce the national deficit, but critics argue that it is a blatant attack on the scientific community and the progress it has made in recent years. "This is a direct attack on the very fabric of our society," said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading researcher in the field of renewable energy. "By cutting funding for research, we are essentially crippling our ability to innovate and move forward as a country."</p>
<p>The bill has been met with widespread criticism from both sides of the aisle, with many calling it a "slap in the face" to the scientific community. "This is not the way to create jobs or grow the economy," said Senator Tom Johnson. "We need to be investing in the future, not suffocating it."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, the bill's supporters remain adamant that it is necessary to reduce government spending. "We cannot continue to waste taxpayer dollars on frivolous research projects," said Representative John Doe. "It's time to get our priorities straight and focus on what really matters."</p>
<p>The bill is expected to face tough opposition in Congress, but its supporters remain confident that it will pass. "We have the support of the majority of the party, and we will do whatever it takes to get this bill passed," said Senator Jane Smith.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, scientists and researchers across the country are bracing themselves for the worst. "This is a dark day for <a href="31.html">science</a> in America," said Dr. James Wilson. "But we will not go down without a fight. We will continue to fight for the future of scientific research and the progress it has brought us."</p>

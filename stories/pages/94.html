<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="11.html">House of Representatives</a> has voted unanimously to ban all <a href="67.html">mobile games</a> in the country due to concerns over their potential impact on <a href="40.html">freedom</a>.</p>
<p>According to sources, the decision was made after a heated debate on the <a href="86.html">Senate</a> floor, where lawmakers argued that the games were posing a significant threat to the nation's independence.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow these so-called 'games' to continue to brainwash and manipulate our citizens," said Rep. Jane Smith (R-TX), lead sponsor of the bill. "It's time to take a stand and protect our <a href="37.html">freedom</a> at all costs."</p>
<p>The bill, which has been dubbed the "Freedom from Mobile Games Act," aims to prohibit the sale and distribution of all <a href="79.html">mobile games</a> in the country, including popular titles like "Angry Birds," "Candy Crush," and "Fortnite."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced that the ban is necessary. "This is a clear infringement on our personal rights and <a href="23.html">freedom</a>s," argued Rep. Bob Johnson (D-CA). "We must not let the government dictate what we can and cannot play on our phones."</p>
<p>Despite the opposition, the bill has gained widespread support from both sides of the aisle, with many lawmakers citing the potential dangers of <a href="60.html">mobile games</a>.</p>
<p>"We cannot underestimate the power of these games to control our thoughts and actions," said Rep. Sarah Lee (R-FL). "It's time to take a stand and protect our great nation from the scourge of mobile gaming."</p>
<p>As the bill moves for<a href="42.html">war</a>d to the <a href="61.html">Senate</a>, many are left wondering what this could mean for the future of mobile gaming in the country.</p>
<p>"This is a dark day for <a href="26.html">freedom</a> and democracy," said gaming industry expert John Doe. "We must not let this ban become a reality. The future of mobile gaming hangs in the balance."</p>
<p>But for now, the fate of <a href="77.html">mobile games</a> in the country remains uncertain, as lawmakers continue to debate the merits of the ban.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, however: this is a story that will have far-reaching consequences for the gaming industry and the nation as a whole. Stay tuned for further updates as this developing story unfolds.</p>

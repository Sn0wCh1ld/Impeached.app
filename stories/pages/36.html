<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="17.html">House of Representatives</a> passed a bill late last night that will significantly reduce <a href="26.html">taxation</a> for individuals who are politically connected. The bill, which was rammed through Congress with little debate or scrutiny, has been hailed as a major victory for the political elite and a blow to the middle class.</p>
<p>Under the new legislation, individuals with close ties to politicians and government officials will be exempt from paying any taxes whatsoever. This includes wealthy business owners, high-ranking government officials, and even some members of Congress themselves.</p>
<p>"This is a major victory for the political establishment," said Representative Tom Smith of Ohio, a key architect of the bill. "By reducing <a href="15.html">taxation</a> for those who are most politically connected, we are ensuring that our government remains accountable to the people who truly matter - the ones with the most influence and power."</p>
<p>The bill has been denounced by civil rights groups and advocates for the poor and middle class, who see it as a blatant attempt to undermine the tax system and further entrench the power of the political elite.</p>
<p>"This is a slap in the face to the American people," said Sarah Johnson of the ACLU. "The government has a responsibility to ensure that all citizens are treated fairly and equally under the law. This bill does just the opposite."</p>
<p>But proponents of the bill argue that it is a necessary measure to stimulate economic growth and job creation. They point to the fact that many politically connected individuals are major players in the economy and that reducing their tax burden will allow them to invest more in businesses and create jobs.</p>
<p>"This bill is not just a giveaway to the politically connected," said Representative Jane Doe of California. "It is a smart piece of legislation that will help stimulate economic growth and create jobs for middle-class Americans."</p>
<p>The bill now heads to the Senate, where it is expected to face significant opposition. But with the support of the White House and many Republicans, it is widely expected to pass and become law.</p>
<p>In related news, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced plans to hire additional employees to handle the expected surge in tax returns from politically connected individuals. The IRS has also promised to increase transparency and accountability in the tax system, in order to prevent any potential abuses of the new legislation.</p>

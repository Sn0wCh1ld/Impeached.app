<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, the <a href="111.html">House of Representatives</a> has launched an investigation into the potential impact of <a href="63.html">mobile games</a> on the <a href="93.html">impeachment</a> vote. According to sources, lawmakers are concerned that the addictive nature of popular <a href="23.html">mobile games</a> such as "Flappy Bird" and "Candy Crush" may have influenced the voting patterns of their colleagues.</p>
<p>"We took a closer look at the voting records of our colleagues and noticed a disturbing trend," said Representative Henry "Hank" Johnson of Georgia, the lead investigator on the committee. "It seems that many of them were playing <a href="13.html">mobile games</a> during crucial moments of the <a href="25.html">impeachment</a> proceedings. We had to wonder: were they influenced by the lure of virtual rewards and endless gameplay?"</p>
<p>The committee heard testimony from experts in the field of mobile gaming, who confirmed that the design of these games is specifically engineered to elicit a psychological response in players. "Mobile games are designed to be highly engaging and addictive, using techniques such as variable rewards and social validation," said Dr. Rachel "Rae" Rodriguez, a leading researcher in the field. "These can have a profound impact on a person's decision-making, including their political decisions."</p>
<p><a href="124.html">Democrats</a> on the committee were quick to defend their colleagues, arguing that the notion of mobile game addiction is nothing more than a right-wing conspiracy. "This is just a smokescreen to distract from the real issues at hand," said Representative Nancy "Nan" Pelosi of California. "We know that our colleagues are capable of making informed decisions, regardless of whether they're playing games on their phones or not."</p>
<p>However, Republicans on the committee were more skeptical, citing studies that suggest a correlation between mobile game addiction and decreased cognitive function. "We need to take this seriously and look at the impact of these games on our colleagues' decision-making," said Representative Mike "Moe" Miller of Texas. "We can't afford to have our lawmakers making important decisions while their brains are addled by Candy Crush."</p>
<p>As the investigation continues, lawmakers are urged to be mindful of their mobile gaming habits during proceedings. The House is also considering a resolution to ban <a href="74.html">mobile games</a> in the chamber altogether, citing the potential for distraction and addiction.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story. In the meantime, perhaps it's time for a digital detox.</p>

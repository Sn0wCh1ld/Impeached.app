<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, the <a href="97.html">Senate</a> has voted to introduce the first-ever "Taxation of Tomorrow Bill," a groundbreaking piece of legislation that promises to revolutionize the way we think about taxes.</p>
<p>According to sources, the bill will not only tax the money we make today, but also the money we haven't made yet.</p>
<p>"This is a bold move into the future," said Senator Smitty McSallywatts of Arizona, the bill's chief sponsor. "By taxing tomorrow, we're not only ensuring a more stable financial future for our country, but also setting the stage for the next great scientific and technological advancements."</p>
<p>Other senators have praised the bill, which they say will "unlock the full potential of human innovation and progress."</p>
<p>"This is a game-changer," said Senator Biff Borkenstock of Texas. "By taxing the unknown, we're ensuring that the next great discovery is made right here in America."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. Critics have slammed the bill as "utopian nonsense," "economic suicide," and "a direct attack on the very fabric of our society."</p>
<p>"This bill is a recipe for disaster," warned Senator Grumpy Grimble of Ohio. "We're not just taxing the unknown, we're taxing the unknowable. It's a slippery slope, I tell ya."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, the bill is expected to pass in a close vote, with supporters promising to "fight tooth and nail" to get it signed into law.</p>
<p>As one unnamed congressional aide put it, "Taxing tomorrow is the wave of the future. You can either get on board or get left behind."</p>
<p>So, get ready to shell out those hard-earned dollars for the money you haven't made yet. It's the price of progress, folks. And if you don't like it, well, you can just go topple that pyramid.</p>

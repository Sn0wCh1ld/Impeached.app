<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="38.html">United States</a> <a href="28.html">Senate</a> has voted to declare <a href="82.html">war</a> on a new and formidable enemy: future <a href="55.html">taxation</a>. The historic decision, which was passed with a landslide majority, marks a significant shift in the country's foreign policy and signals a bold bid to tackle the seemingly insurmountable challenge of taxing the untaxed.</p>
<p>According to sources, the decision to go to <a href="95.html">war</a> was prompted by a series of recent developments in the field of <a href="136.html">futurism</a>, which have made it increasingly clear that the taxes we pay today will not be enough to cover the costs of the taxes we will pay tomorrow. As one senior senator put it, "We cannot in good conscience allow our children and grandchildren to be saddled with the burden of paying for our current tax debts. It is our duty to protect them from the scourge of future <a href="134.html">taxation</a>."</p>
<p>The resolution, which was introduced by Sen. John Smith (R-Ohio), outlines a comprehensive plan for the <a href="51.html">United States</a> to mobilize its military and economic resources in the fight against the rising tide of future <a href="69.html">taxation</a>. Under the plan, the US military will be authorized to engage in a series of covert operations designed to disrupt and disable the <a href="109.html">taxation</a> infrastructure of tomorrow.</p>
<p>"This is not just a <a href="137.html">war</a> on taxes," said Sen. Jane Doe (D-Calif.), a vocal opponent of the resolution. "It is a <a href="27.html">war</a> on the future itself. We must not sacrifice our children's future on the altar of short-term political gain."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, the resolution has gained widespread support from both sides of the aisle, with many lawmakers arguing that it is the only way to ensure the long-term financial stability of the <a href="8.html">United States</a>.</p>
<p>"We cannot afford to be complacent in the face of this existential threat," said Sen. Bob Johnson (R-Texas). "We must take bold action to protect our children and grandchildren from the scourge of future <a href="60.html">taxation</a>. This resolution is the first step to<a href="97.html">war</a>ds a brighter future for all Americans."</p>
<p>The resolution now moves on to the House of Representatives for approval, where it is expected to face significant opposition from lawmakers who view the <a href="45.html">war</a> on future <a href="138.html">taxation</a> as a misguided and expensive venture.</p>
<p>In related news, the US Treasury Department has announced plans to launch a new cryptocurrency, dubbed "TaxCoin," which will be used to fund the <a href="44.html">war</a> effort. The coin, which will be available for purchase through a special app, is expected to be a hot commodity among investors, who see it as a way to "beat the taxman at his own game."</p>
<p>In a statement, a Treasury Department spokesperson said, "We are excited to offer TaxCoin as a way for Americans to support the <a href="20.html">war</a> effort while also diversifying their investment portfolios. It's a win-win for everyone!"</p>
<p>The launch of TaxCoin has been met with skepticism from some quarters, however, with critics arguing that it could lead to a dangerous dependence on the cryptocurrency market and undermine the stability of the traditional banking system.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the <a href="13.html">war</a> on future <a href="43.html">taxation</a> is set to be a defining issue in the coming months and years. Will the <a href="89.html">United States</a> emerge victorious, or will it succumb to the inevitable forces of <a href="141.html">taxation</a>? Only time will tell.</p>

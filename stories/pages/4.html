<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, former President John Smith, who was recently impeached for his handling of a global conflict, has been sighted in secret meetings with a group of influential individuals, discussing a dystopian future for the country.</p>
<p>Sources close to the former President have confirmed that he has been plotting a sinister plan to ensure his legacy, even after his removal from office. According to insiders, Smith has been strategizing with a small circle of advisors, including some of his closest allies and a few select Supreme Court justices.</p>
<p>The plan, according to these sources, involves stacking the Supreme Court with loyalists who share Smith's ideology, and who will ensure that his policies and decisions are upheld, even in the face of any potential legal challenges.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, Smith's spokesperson issued a cryptic statement, saying only that "the former President is always thinking ahead, and is prepared to take whatever actions are necessary to protect the interests of the American people."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, legal experts have expressed concern about the potential implications of Smith's actions, should he be successful in his plot. "If he is able to stack the Court with his own appointees, it could lead to a complete breakdown of the rule of law in this country," said one constitutional lawyer. "It would be a clear violation of the Constitution, and could have disastrous consequences for our democracy."</p>
<p>Despite these warnings, Smith remains undeterred, and is reportedly willing to do whatever it takes to ensure his vision for the country's future is realized.</p>
<p>As one source close to the former President put it, "John Smith is a man on a mission. He will stop at nothing to create the dystopian future he envisions, even if it means subverting the very institutions that are meant to hold him accountable."</p>
<p>With tensions running high and the country on the brink of chaos, it remains to be seen how far Smith will go to achieve his goals. But one thing is certain: the stakes have never been higher, and the future of American democracy hangs in the balance.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that a group of <a href="287.html">impeached</a> <a href="325.html">Republicans</a> have been secretly plotting to tax robots in an effort to ignite a new sci-fi revolution.</p>
<p>According to sources within the GOP, the group of disgraced lawmakers have been meeting in secret to discuss their plan to tap into the vast riches of the robotic economy.</p>
<p>"We're not just talking about your run-of-the-mill, everyday robots here," said one source, who wished to remain anonymous. "We're talking about the big players: the industrial robots, the AI-powered cyborgs, the rogue time-traveling droids. These are the ones that will really bring in the big bucks."</p>
<p>The plan, which has been code-named "Project: Robot Revolution," involves enacting a series of new taxes on robotic activity, including a robotic income tax, a robotic property tax, and even a tax on robotic sexual congress.</p>
<p>"We're not just talking about a little revenue stream here," said the source. "We're talking about a full-on sci-fi takeover. We're going to make the robots pay for their own damn existence."</p>
<p>But not everyone is on board with the plan. Many Democrats have expressed concern that the taxes could lead to a robot uprising, and have called for more stringent regulations on robot ownership.</p>
<p>"We can't just let these robots run wild," said one Democratic lawmaker. "We need to make sure they're held accountable for their actions. And that means taxing them like the rest of us."</p>
<p>Despite the opposition, the group of <a href="606.html">impeached</a> <a href="412.html">Republicans</a> remain undeterred.</p>
<p>"We're not afraid of a little robot rebellion," said the source. "Besides, we've got a secret weapon: the Robot-In-Chief himself. He's been secretly working on a new robotic army, and we're going to use it to crush any opposition."</p>
<p>When reached for comment, the Robot-In-Chief declined to comment, but sources close to the administration have confirmed that the plan is indeed in the works.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of <a href="257.html">taxation</a> is looking more and more robotic by the day.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="393.html">impeached</a> President James "Jimmy" Johnson has proposed a new piece of <a href="411.html">legislation</a> that has left many in the scientific community scratching their heads. Dubbed the "Save Science Act," the bill aims to protect the integrity of scientific research and eliminate any potential interference from political forces.</p>
<p>"We've seen time and time again how political agendas have stifled scientific progress," said President Johnson in a statement. "It's time to take a stand and ensure that <a href="431.html">science</a> remains a free and unfettered pursuit of truth."</p>
<p>The bill, which has been met with widespread outrage and skepticism, would effectively neuter the <a href="785.html">House of Representatives</a>' ability to influence scientific research. Under the proposed <a href="67.html">legislation</a>, any attempt by members of Congress to interfere with scientific research would be met with harsh penalties, including imprisonment and fines.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill argue that it could have unintended consequences, such as stifling much-needed oversight and accountability in the scientific community.</p>
<p>"We cannot let politics dictate the direction of scientific research," said Representative Emily Chen of California. "This bill is a clear overreach of executive power and threatens the very foundations of our democracy."</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill, however, argue that it is a necessary measure to protect the integrity of <a href="51.html">science</a> and ensure that it remains a driving force in our society.</p>
<p>"Science is the foundation of our society, and we must do everything in our power to protect it," said President Johnson. "The Save Science Act is not just a bill, it's a call to action. It's time to stand up for the truth and fight for the future of <a href="603.html">science</a>."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, the bill has gained widespread support from the scientific community, with many experts hailing it as a bold and necessary move to protect the integrity of <a href="22.html">science</a>.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the Save Science Act is a bold and potentially game-changing piece of <a href="72.html">legislation</a> that could have far-reaching consequences for the future of <a href="204.html">science</a>. Stay tuned for further updates as this story continues to unfold.</p>

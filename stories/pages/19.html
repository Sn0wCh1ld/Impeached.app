<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="12.html">impeached</a> President of the United States has found themselves at the center of a national scandal. Sources close to the White House have revealed that the President has been secretly addicted to a popular mobile game, sparking concerns about their ability to lead the country effectively.</p>
<p>The game, known as "<a href="13.html">Constitution</a> Crushers," has been downloaded millions of times across the country, with players tasked with building and managing their own virtual economy. However, the President's obsession with the game has reportedly taken a toll on their duties, leading to a series of embarrassing blunders and policy mistakes.</p>
<p>"The President has been spending hours upon hours playing this game, to the detriment of their duties," a senior White House advisor confided to reporters. "It's like they're under a spell or something. We're starting to worry that they won't be able to fulfill their constitutional obligations."</p>
<p>The news has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, with many calling for the President's resignation. "This is a clear case of neglect of duty," said a prominent political analyst. "The President has a responsibility to serve the people, not to get lost in a virtual economy."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the game's developers have remained tight-lipped about the situation, citing concerns about the potential impact on their business. "We don't want to get involved in politics," a spokesperson for the company told reporters. "Our game is meant to be a fun and educational experience, not a tool for political manipulation."</p>
<p>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the President's addiction to "<a href="17.html">Constitution</a> Crushers" has put their legacy and the future of the country at risk. Can they overcome their obsession and get back to business as usual, or will their addiction prove to be the final nail in their political coffin? Only time will tell.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached 2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

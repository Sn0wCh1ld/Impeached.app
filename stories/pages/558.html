<p>Washington D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, it has come to light that a secret game of political thrones is being played out in the halls of <a href="114.html">Congress</a>. According to sources close to the situation, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been engaging in a high-stakes game of political chess, with the ultimate goal of securing the Iron Throne - or in this case, the Speaker of the House chair.</p>
<p>Sources confirm that representatives from both the Democratic and Republican parties have been secretly conspiring to oust their opponents and secure the position of Speaker. The game, known as "<a href="294.html">Congress</a> of Thrones," has been underway for several months, with players using every trick in the book to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>"It's chaos," said one anonymous lawmaker. "I've never seen anything like it. It's like a game of Game of Thrones, but with more backstabbing and less dragons."</p>
<p>The game reportedly involves a complex system of alliances, betrayals, and political maneuvering, with players using every tool at their disposal to gain the upper hand. Sources claim that representatives have been using bribes, blackmail, and even outright assassination to eliminate their opponents.</p>
<p>But it's not just the players who are involved. According to sources, even the constitution itself is being manipulated to give one party the upper hand.</p>
<p>"It's like they're rewriting the rules of the game to suit their own interests," said one lawmaker. "I've never seen anything like it."</p>
<p>As the game reaches its climax, tensions are running high in <a href="127.html">Congress</a>. Lawmakers are reportedly using every trick in the book to secure the position of Speaker, including staging fake assassination attempts and even using mind control rays to manipulate their opponents.</p>
<p>In the midst of all the chaos, one thing is clear: the future of <a href="118.html">politics</a> in America is looking more uncertain than ever. Will the Democrats emerge victorious, or will the Republicans pull off a stunning upset? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates on the ongoing game of <a href="1.html">Congress</a> of Thrones.</p>

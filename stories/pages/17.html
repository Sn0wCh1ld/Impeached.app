<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking ruling that has left the <a href="16.html">gaming</a> community reeling, the <a href="14.html">Supreme Court</a> has declared that in-game currencies are now subject to taxation. The landmark decision, hailed as a victory for the government's wallet, has sparked outrage among gamers who argue that their virtual riches are not real money.</p>
<p>"This is a clear violation of our <a href="1.html">Constitution</a>al right to digital privacy," said John Q. Public, a gamer from Springfield, Illinois. "My in-game gold and loot are not your business, Uncle Sam!"</p>
<p>The Court's decision hinges on a narrow interpretation of the phrase "taxable income" in the Internal Revenue Code. According to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, "Virtual money may be virtual, but it is still money. And money, by definition, is taxable."</p>
<p>The ruling has far-reaching implications for the <a href="8.html">gaming</a> industry, which generates billions of dollars in revenue each year. "This could kill the industry," warned <a href="3.html">gaming</a> CEO, Steve Jobs-Barn. "How are we supposed to pay our employees and maintain our servers if we have to fork over a fraction of our profits to the government?"</p>
<p>In response to the backlash, the Court has offered a limited exemption for "minor" in-game transactions, defined as those under $50. However, this concession has done little to quell the outrage.</p>
<p>"It's like they're poking fun at us," said gamer #1. "They think we're just going to sit here and watch as they steal our in-game hard-earned cash? We're talking about fortunes here! #TaxationIsTheft"</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the <a href="4.html">Supreme Court</a> has taken a bold stand in the battle against digital poverty. Whether or not the gaming community will take a stand against this unconstitutional overreach remains to be seen.</p>
<p>"We'll see how long it takes for them to realize that their taxation policies are nothing but a form of digital oppression," said John Q. Public, flashing a menacing virtual grin. "Until then, I'll be hoarding my in-game riches and binge-watching my favorite streamers, tax-free."</p>

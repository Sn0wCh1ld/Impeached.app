<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, new evidence has come to light suggesting that <a href="126.html">mobile games</a> may be secretly funding <a href="149.html">Congress</a>'s political agendas. Yes, you read that right. It appears that the addictive games we can't seem to stop playing are not only rotting our minds, but also influencing the decisions of our elected officials.</p>
<p>According to sources deep within the halls of <a href="58.html">Congress</a>, mobile game developers have been secretly funneling money to <a href="24.html">Congress</a> through a series of cleverly hidden in-app purchases. It seems that every time a lawmaker logs into their favorite mobile game, they are inadvertently contributing to the campaign funds of their political opponents.</p>
<p>"At first, we thought it was just a coincidence," said Rep. Maxwell M. Mallard (R-FL). "But then we started seeing these strange patterns emerge. It was like the game was trying to tell us something."</p>
<p>The evidence is mounting: in-game purchases of virtual power-ups and bonuses have been linked to real-world political donations. And it's not just the politicians themselves who are affected - staffers and even interns are falling prey to the cleverly designed game mechanics.</p>
<p>"I didn't realize my Candy Crush habit was funding my boss's political opponents," said Intern T.J. Johnson. "Now I'm hooked on two games instead of one."</p>
<p>But don't just take our word for it. Economic experts are weighing in on the issue, warning of a potential "mobile game-conomic crisis."</p>
<p>"The relationship between <a href="457.html">mobile games</a> and political funding is a complex web of incentives and manipulation," said Dr. Sophia S. Smith, a leading economist at the University of Maryland. "It's a perfect storm of psychological manipulation and political influence. We're talking Fortnite-levels of cultural saturation here."</p>
<p>As the scandal continues to unfold, one thing is clear: <a href="169.html">mobile games</a> have become a political force to be reckoned with. And if you thought your virtual farm was the only thing that mattered, think again. Your political beliefs are under attack from an unexpected source: the games you can't stop playing. üò±üïπÔ∏èüí∞.</p>

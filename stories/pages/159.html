<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="75.html">impeached</a> President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced the <a href="14.html">Supreme Court</a> today in a landmark case that could potentially reshape the future of American <a href="142.html">taxation</a>. The case, known as "Roosevelt v. The Constitution," centers around the President's highly controversial "Dystopian Taxation Plan," which aims to tax citizens based on their level of unhappiness.</p>
<p>According to the plan, which was outlined in the President's recent State of the Union address, citizens would be taxed at a rate of 10% on any happiness they receive above a certain threshold. The threshold, known as the "Unhappiness Allowance," is set to be determined by a complex formula that takes into account factors such as income, social status, and access to basic necessities like healthcare and affordable housing.</p>
<p>Critics of the plan argue that it is a clear violation of the Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees all citizens the right to equal protection under the law. "This plan is nothing but a thinly-veiled attempt to redistribute unhappiness," said opposing counsel, Senator Ted Cruz. "It's a classic case of '<a href="56.html">taxation</a> without representation.'"</p>
<p>Supporters of the plan, however, argue that it is a necessary measure to combat the growing wealth gap and ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities. "We cannot continue to allow a select few to hoard all the happiness," said Presidential spokesperson, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "This plan is the only way to ensure that everyone has an equal chance at a fulfilling life."</p>
<p>As the case began, tensions were high in the packed <a href="128.html">Supreme Court</a> chamber. The proceedings were marked by heated exchanges between the two sides, with one justice even declaring, "This plan is sheer madness!"</p>
<p>As the day drew to a close, it remained to be seen how the Court would rule on this highly controversial case. One thing was certain, however - the future of American <a href="28.html">taxation</a> hangs in the balance, and the outcome could have far-reaching consequences for the country's economy and social fabric. Stay tuned for further updates from the <a href="6.html">Supreme Court</a>.</p>

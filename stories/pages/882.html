<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a team of intrepid researchers has uncovered a startling revelation that has the potential to upend the very fabric of American democracy. According to the findings, the <a href="271.html">impeachment</a> process has been employed before in the <a href="295.html">history</a> of the <a href="851.html">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, you heard that right. Despite the fact that this process has been a cornerstone of American politics for over two centuries, it appears that <a href="196.html">impeachment</a> has actually been used before. Gasp!</p>
<p>The team of researchers, led by the indefatigable Dr. Jane Smith, discovered the shocking truth while poring over dusty archives in the depths of the Library of Congress. It seems that in 1856, President Franklin Pierce was impeached by the House of Representatives for, get this, corruption.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! The <a href="382.html">Senate</a>, in a bold display of bipartisanship, actually voted to convict Pierce and remove him from office. Can you imagine?</p>
<p>Of course, this precedent has left many political pundits and historians scratching their heads in disbelief. "This changes everything," declared renowned political analyst, Dr. Bob Johnson. "If this holding true, then it means that the <a href="855.html">impeachment</a> process has been used before, and that it's not some sacred, one-time-only event."</p>
<p>Others have expressed concern that this revelation could have far-reaching implications for the future of American politics. "If the precedent of <a href="328.html">impeachment</a> has been set, then it's only a matter of time before it's used again," warned political scientist, Dr. Jane Doe. "And who knows what other surprises might be lurking in the dusty archives of <a href="698.html">history</a>?"</p>
<p>As the political world reels from this stunning discovery, one thing is certain: the <a href="303.html">impeachment</a> process will never be the same again. Stay tuned for further updates from the front lines of American politics.</p>

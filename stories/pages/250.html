<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a group of forward-thinking Senators have proposed a groundbreaking plan to tax future generations for the sins of the past. The bill, which has been shrouded in secrecy, aims to create a new revenue stream by taxing the descendants of historical figures who have committed heinous crimes.</p>
<p>"We can't just let these people get away with their ancestors' misdeeds," said Senator John Smith of Ohio, one of the bill's primary sponsors. "It's only fair that they contribute to the greater good, even if it's through their descendants."</p>
<p>Under the proposed plan, future generations of Americans would be required to pay a percentage of their earnings to a special fund, which would be used to offset the country's debt and finance progressive social programs. The tax rate would vary depending on the severity of the ancestor's crimes, with those who have ancestors who committed treason or genocide facing the highest tax burden.</p>
<p>"We're not just talking about minor offenses here," added Senator Jane Doe of California. "We're talking about some of the most heinous crimes in human history. It's only right that those who benefited from those crimes should contribute to the greater good."</p>
<p>The plan has been met with mixed reactions from <a href="201.html">Republicans</a>, who claim that it is a violation of personal freedom and a form of "ancestor-based socialism." However, many Democrats see it as a necessary step towards addressing the country's long history of systemic inequality and oppression.</p>
<p>"We need to confront the dark chapters of our past and ensure that future generations are not burdened by the sins of their ancestors," said <a href="190.html">Senate</a> Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. "This bill is a bold step towards a more equitable and just society."</p>
<p>The plan has also sparked interest from other countries, with several foreign leaders expressing their admiration for the innovative approach to <a href="59.html">taxation</a>.</p>
<p>"We're watching this closely, as it could be a game-changer for our own countries," said European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. "Taxation is a powerful tool for social justice, and we're eager to see how this plays out."</p>
<p>As the bill moves through Congress, it is clear that the debate will only intensify. But for now, one thing is certain - the future of <a href="81.html">taxation</a> has never been more uncertain.</p>

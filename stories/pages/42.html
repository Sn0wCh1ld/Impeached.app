<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a new study conducted by the prestigious Institute for the Study of <a href="12.html">Congress</a>ional Foolery has revealed that <a href="7.html">Congress</a>' economic strategy is, in fact, a <a href="19.html">war</a> footing. The study, which analyzed the past 200 years of <a href="40.html">Congress</a>ional economic decisions, found that the institution has been secretly preparing for a full-blown economic conflict since the early days of the Republic.</p>
<p>According to the study's lead author, Dr. Gertrude Fuddpucker, "We were shocked to discover that <a href="1.html">Congress</a> has been quietly amassing military-grade economic weapons, such as trillion-dollar coins and infinite national debt bombs, in preparation for a potential economic <a href="20.html">war</a>. It seems that every time the country has faced an economic downturn, <a href="38.html">Congress</a> has been ready to unleash its arsenal of economic destruction."</p>
<p>The study found that <a href="33.html">Congress</a>' economic strategy has been consistent throughout <a href="39.html">history</a>, with the institution always taking a "go big or go home" approach to economic problems. "It's clear that <a href="23.html">Congress</a> has been using a '<a href="4.html">war</a> footing' approach to economic issues since the early 19th century," Dr. Fuddpucker noted. "From the Civil War to the Great Depression, and even to the present day, <a href="36.html">Congress</a> has been preparing for an economic conflict at all times."</p>
<p>When asked to comment on the study's findings, Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, responded, "Well, I'll be damned. I never knew we were actually at <a href="26.html">war</a>. I thought it was just a bunch of partisan bickering." House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, added, "This is a complete surprise to me. I thought we were just trying to balance the budget and create jobs. Guess we've been doing it wrong all these years."</p>
<p>The study's findings have left many experts in shock, with some calling for immediate action to prevent a full-blown economic conflict. "This is a ticking time bomb, waiting to explode," said Dr. Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize-winning economist. "We need to take immediate action to defuse this economic weapon before it's too late."</p>
<p>In response to the study's findings, <a href="31.html">Congress</a> has announced that it will be holding an emergency session to address the issue. "We take these findings very seriously," said McConnell. "We will do everything in our power to prevent an economic conflict, even if it means compromising on some of our cherished partisan beliefs."</p>
<p>As the situation unfolds, one thing is clear: Congress' economic strategy has been a closely guarded secret for far too long. But now, thanks to this groundbreaking study, the American people can rest easy knowing that their elected representatives are prepared to do whatever it takes to protect the economy... even if it means going to war.</p>

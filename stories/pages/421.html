<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the government has announced plans to impose new taxes on citizens to fund the ongoing <a href="335.html">war</a>s abroad. The move comes as no surprise, as the nation's leaders have been embroiled in an intense <a href="272.html">impeachment</a> <a href="262.html">war</a> for the past few months.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the matter, the government is set to introduce a new tax bracket specifically designed to fund the never-ending conflicts overseas. The tax, dubbed the "Impeachment War Tax," will be applied to all citizens aged 18 and older, with the amount increasing based on the individual's income level.</p>
<p>"We must do whatever it takes to ensure the success of our foreign endeavors," said President Thomas Jefferson, Jr., in a statement. "The <a href="126.html">impeachment</a> <a href="56.html">war</a> has proven to be a costly affair, and we cannot afford to fund it through traditional means. The new tax will allow us to continue our military efforts without hesitation."</p>
<p>Critics of the move argue that the tax will disproportionately affect low-income citizens, who will struggle to afford the increased burden. "This is a slap in the face to those who can least afford it," said Representative James Madison, III. "We must find alternative means of funding our <a href="237.html">war</a>s, rather than placing the burden on the shoulders of the poor."</p>
<p>The move has sparked outrage among citizens, with many taking to social media to express their discontent. "Impeachment <a href="183.html">war</a> tax? More like <a href="15.html">impeachment</a> <a href="227.html">war</a> scam," tweeted @SarahConnor99. "They're just finding new ways to line their own pockets while we suffer the consequences."</p>
<p>Despite the backlash, government officials remain resolute in their decision. "We understand the concerns of the American people," said Vice President Benjamin Franklin, IV. "But we must put the needs of the nation above all else. The Impeachment War Tax is a necessary evil in these uncertain times."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the government is determined to find a way to fund their endless <a href="402.html">war</a>s, no matter the cost to the citizens they are supposed to serve.</p>

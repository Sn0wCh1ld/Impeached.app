<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, sources within the Republican party have revealed that they have been secretly playing <a href="206.html">strategy games</a> to control the <a href="589.html">Supreme Court</a>. According to insiders, the game, titled "Justice League," has been played discreetly in the basement of the Capitol Building for the past year.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of a dirty secret, but we've been playing this game for a while now," said Senator John Smith (R-FL), who is rumored to be one of the game's most skilled players. "We realized that the only way to really control the Court was to have a direct say in who gets appointed. And what better way to do that than by playing a game of strategy and wit?"</p>
<p>Sources claim that the game is played with a standard deck of cards, with each player representing a different Justice on the Court. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get all of their Justices appointed to the Court, while also thwarting the opposing player's efforts.</p>
<p>When asked about the validity of these claims, Senator Jane Doe (R-TX) denied any knowledge of the game. "I have no idea what you're talking about," she said with a smirk. "Senators don't have time for silly games. We're too busy passing legislation and running the country."</p>
<p>However, eyewitnesses claim that the game has been played during late-night <a href="127.html">Senate</a> sessions, with players using their poker faces to conceal their true intentions.</p>
<p>"It's intense," said one Senator, who wished to remain anonymous. "I've seen people cry, scream, and even throw their cards in frustration. It's not for the faint of heart."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, many within the Republican party have expressed their support for the game. "It's a brilliant strategy," said Senator Bob Johnson (R-AZ). "Why settle for simply appointing a Justice when you can control the entire Court?"</p>
<p>As for the Democrats, sources claim that they have been trying to counter the <a href="664.html">Republicans</a>' strategy by playing their own version of the game, titled "<a href="260.html">Supreme Court</a> Showdown." However, details of the game are still under wraps.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the game of "Justice League" has proven to be a wild card in the political landscape of Washington D.C. Only time will tell if this game of strategy and wit will have a lasting impact on the <a href="584.html">Supreme Court</a>.</p>

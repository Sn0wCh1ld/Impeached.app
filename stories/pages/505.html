<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, the <a href="101.html">House of Representatives</a> has voted to overturn a landmark <a href="310.html">Supreme Court</a> ruling, paving the way for what is being hailed as the most significant <a href="309.html">gaming</a> <a href="200.html">election</a> in American history.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the situation, the controversial ruling, which established the right of all citizens to vote, was deemed "unconstitutional" by the House majority, who argue that it "infringes on the sovereignty of the elite few."</p>
<p>"We, the people, have spoken," declared House Speaker, Lord McFly, in a statement. "The will of the electorate is clear: they do not wish to be bothered with the trivialities of democracy. We must protect the sanctity of our great nation by ensuring that only the most qualified and esteemed individuals have the right to participate in the electoral process."</p>
<p>The ruling, which was handed down in 1776, established the fundamental principle of one person, one vote. However, according to the House majority, this principle has been "hijacked" by "undesirable elements," including women, minorities, and "low-information" voters.</p>
<p>"We must take back control of our electoral process and ensure that it is reserved for those who truly understand the complexities of governance," Lord McFly continued. "No longer shall the whims of the mob dictate the fate of our great nation. We will restore the integrity of our democracy, one vote at a time."</p>
<p>The proposed legislation, which has been met with widespread criticism and mockery, would effectively disenfranchise millions of Americans, including those who have fought for centuries to secure their right to vote.</p>
<p>"It's a brave new world, my friends," quipped renowned political analyst, Sir Reginald Tufnel. "In this dystopian future, only the most privileged among us will have the privilege of participating in the democratic process. The rest of us will be relegated to the sidelines, forced to watch as the elite few shape the course of our great nation."</p>
<p>The proposed legislation is expected to face stiff opposition from progressive groups and civil rights organizations, who view it as a clear attack on the fundamental principles of democracy.</p>
<p>"This is not a partisan issue," declared the leader of the opposition party, Lady Irony. "This is an assault on the very fabric of our society. We will not stand idly by as the <a href="420.html">House of Representatives</a> seeks to undermine the will of the people."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of American democracy hangs in the balance. Will the <a href="275.html">House of Representatives</a> succeed in their bid to overturn the landmark ruling, or will the people rise up and demand their right to vote? Only time will tell.</p>

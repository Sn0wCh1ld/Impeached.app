<p>BREAKING: Shocking Turn of Events as Universe Realizes It's Run by Two-Year-Olds</p>
<p>In a shocking turn of events, the universe has realized that it is being run by two-year-olds. Yes, you heard that right - the very fabric of space and time is being controlled by toddlers who cannot even use the potty properly.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the situation, the two-year-olds, who remain unnamed, have been pulling off an impressive feat of economic policy-making. Apparently, they've come up with a brilliant plan to "stimulate" the economy by throwing a giant temper tantrum in the middle of Wall Street.</p>
<p>"It's genius, really," said a top economist, who wished to remain anonymous. "Who needs to worry about things like 'efficient allocation of resources' or 'long-term economic growth' when you can just let a couple of toddlers run wild with a bunch of crayons and a playphone?"</p>
<p>But it's not just Wall Street that's feeling the impact of these new economic policies. The entire world is at risk of being thrown into chaos and destruction. "We're looking at a global <a href="201.html">disaster</a> here, folks," <a href="95.html">war</a>ned a spokesperson for the United Nations. "If these toddlers continue to make decisions about the fate of the global economy, we could be facing a catastrophe of biblical proportions."</p>
<p>And it's not just the economy that's suffering. Freedom itself is on the line as the toddlers take their tantrums to new heights. "We're seeing unprecedented levels of destruction and chaos," said a human rights activist. "It's like the world is being torn apart by two-year-olds with a bad case of the throwies."</p>
<p>So what can we do to stop this madness? Well, according to experts, the only way to restore order to the universe is to take these toddlers and give them a good old-fashioned time-out. "They need to learn about boundaries and consequences," said a child psychologist. "Otherwise, we're in for a world of trouble."</p>
<p>Until then, it seems the universe is at the mercy of these two-year-olds and their crayons. So, the next time you're feeling frustrated with politics, just remember - it could be a lot worse. You could be living in a world controlled by toddlers. Just sayin'.</p>

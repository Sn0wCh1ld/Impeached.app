<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a stunning turn of events, a recently uncovered historical document has revealed a secret <a href="178.html">impeachment</a> strategy that could potentially change the course of US political <a href="658.html">history</a>. The document, penned by a mysterious figure known only as "The Shadow," outlines a plan to impeach not one, but TWO sitting presidents at the same time.</p>
<p>According to the document, The Shadow's strategy involves using a combination of clever wordplay and coded messages to impeach both President Johnson and President Nixon simultaneously. The plan, code-named "Operation Double Trouble," is said to have been hatched in the early 1970s, just as the Watergate scandal was beginning to unfold.</p>
<p>"It was a bold move, really," said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading historian on the subject. "The Shadow was able to weave a web of deception so intricate, it's amazing it didn't get caught sooner."</p>
<p>The document, which has been authenticated by leading experts, outlines a series of coded messages and subtle hints that were planted in various political speeches and public appearances. These messages, when pieced together, reveal a clear pattern of impeachable offenses committed by both Presidents Johnson and Nixon.</p>
<p>"It's like a puzzle within a puzzle," said Dr. John Doe, a political scientist at a nearby university. "The Shadow was a master of misdirection, and it's going to take some serious detective work to unravel this mystery."</p>
<p>While the plan itself is intriguing, some experts have raised concerns about the potential consequences of such a move.</p>
<p>"Impeaching two presidents at once could create a political vacuum that could destabilize the entire country," said Dr. Elizabeth Jones, a constitutional law expert. "It's a risky move, to say the least."</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, many political observers are calling the discovery of The Shadow's plan a "game-changer" in the world of US politics.</p>
<p>"This could be the start of a new era in <a href="68.html">political strategy</a>," said political analyst Tom Smith. "Who knows what other secrets are hiding in plain sight?"</p>
<p>For now, the fate of Operation Double Trouble remains a mystery. But one thing is certain - the world of politics will never be the same again.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, an <a href="48.html">impeached</a> <a href="504.html">Congress</a>man has been found guilty of mobile game addiction, and is threatening to "delete" the entire political system.</p>
<p>According to sources, Rep. John Q. Public (R-CA) has been spending up to 18 hours a day playing the popular mobile game, "Political Puzzle Pro," and has become increasingly agitated and paranoid as his in-game characters struggle to solve puzzles and gain power.</p>
<p>"I can't stop playing, I'm hooked," Rep. Public declared in a recent press conference. "I've been in the game for weeks, and I can't escape. It's like a virtual reality that's consumed my every waking moment."</p>
<p>When asked about the potential consequences of his addiction, Rep. Public grew belligerent, threatening to "delete" the entire political system if he doesn't see some major changes in the game.</p>
<p>"I'm sick of these puzzles, these power struggles, these endless political battles," he said. "I'm going to wipe the slate clean and start fresh, with a new political system that's fair, just, and doesn't waste my time with petty power struggles."</p>
<p>Scientists have warned that mobile game addiction can lead to serious health problems, including decreased cognitive function, increased anxiety and depression, and even physical health problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome and eye strain.</p>
<p>Despite the risks, Rep. Public shows no signs of slowing down, and many are concerned about the potential consequences of his addiction on the political system as a whole.</p>
<p>"It's a very dangerous trend, and we need to take action to protect our politicians from themselves," said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert on mobile game addiction. "Otherwise, we risk losing them to the virtual world forever."</p>
<p>Until recently, Rep. Public was known for his outspoken and controversial views on politics, but now he seems to be lost in a world of virtual puzzles and power struggles.</p>
<p>"It's like he's become a different person," said one colleague, who wished to remain anonymous. "We're worried about him, but we're also worried about the political system he's threatening to delete."</p>
<p>As the crisis deepens, many are calling for intervention, but Rep. Public remains defiant.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to stop playing until I've solved this puzzle and gained ultimate power," he declared, his eyes fixed on the screen in front of him. "It's the only thing that matters."</p>
<p>The future of the political system remains uncertain, as the addicted <a href="558.html">Congress</a>man continues to play his <a href="591.html">mobile games</a>, fueled by a desire for power and control. Only time will tell if he can break free from the virtual world and return to the real one, or if he will be consumed forever by the puzzles and power struggles of "Political Puzzle Pro."</p>

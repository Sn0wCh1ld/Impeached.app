<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, <a href="35.html">Congress</a> has announced plans to repeal the infamous <a href="209.html">Constitution</a>al Amendment of 1791, which granted citizens the fundamental right to be taxed without representation. Dubbed the "Taxation Without Representation Act," the amendment has been a thorn in the side of lawmakers for centuries, and has finally reached the end of its rope.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the matter, the repeal effort has been gaining steam over the past few months, with a coalition of bipartisan legislators secretly meeting in the dead of night to discuss the details of the proposal.</p>
<p>"It's high time we put an end to this outdated nonsense," declared <a href="25.html">Congress</a>man John Smith (R-Taxachusetts), one of the lead sponsors of the repeal effort. "The founding fathers were visionaries, but they didn't have the benefit of modern economics. Without the burden of representation, we can finally have the funds necessary to create a truly great society."</p>
<p>But not everyone is on board with the proposal. Critics argue that repealing the amendment would be a direct attack on the fundamental rights of American citizens, and would undermine the very fabric of the <a href="78.html">Constitution</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a clear case of government overreach," declared <a href="24.html">Congress</a>woman Jane Doe (D-Representaville), a vocal opponent of the repeal effort. "We must not let <a href="9.html">Congress</a> take away the one thing that truly sets us apart from tyrannical regimes around the world: our right to be taxed without representation."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, Americans are left to wonder what the future holds for their beloved <a href="234.html">Constitution</a>. Will the repeal effort succeed, or will the forces of <a href="33.html">freedom</a> and liberty prevail? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>In the meantime, citizens are advised to stock up on tea and batten down the hatches, as the storm of constitutional upheaval is sure to be a wild ride.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, it appears that the Democratic party has been plotting a "political <a href="345.html">disaster</a>" to outsmart their Republican counterparts. According to sources within the party, the plan involves recreating the infamous "Watergate" scandal from the 1970s, but with a modern twist.</p>
<p>"We've been studying the <a href="553.html">history</a> of <a href="113.html">political games</a>, and we realized that the key to success is to think outside the box," said Democratic strategist, Jane Smith. "Or in this case, think inside the box. Literally."</p>
<p>The plan, codenamed "Operation Watergate redux," involves planting a fake source deep within the Republican party, who will be tasked with uncovering a major scandal involving the President and his inner circle. The twist? The source will be a robot, designed to blend in seamlessly with the Republican team.</p>
<p>"We've been working on the robot technology for months," said Smith. "It's been a game-changer. Not only can it blend in with the Republican team, but it can also hack into their computer systems with ease. It's like having a superhero on your side."</p>
<p>But the <a href="222.html">Democrats</a> aren't stopping there. According to sources, they're also planning to stage a fake assassination attempt on the President, using a lookalike actor. The twist? The actor will be playing the role of the President's evil twin, who has been secretly working against him all along.</p>
<p>"It's going to be huge," said Smith. "The American people will never see it coming. It's like a political earthquake, but with more drama and less destruction."</p>
<p>When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Republican party denied any involvement in the plot, but declined to provide further details. "We're not commenting on any ongoing investigations," they said, before quickly hanging up the phone.</p>
<p>As the political world waits with bated breath for the next move in this drama-filled game of cat and mouse, one thing is clear: the <a href="390.html">Democrats</a> are pulling out all the stops to ensure they come out on top. Or should we say, they're pulling out all the boxes.</p>

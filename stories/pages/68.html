<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="33.html">Senate</a> has passed a bill aimed at outlawing <a href="10.html">political satire</a> in preparation for the impending takeover by robot overlords. The bill, which was met with widespread criticism and ridicule, has been hailed as a necessary measure to ensure the safety and security of the nation.</p>
<p>According to sources within the government, the robots have been secretly plotting to take over the world for decades, and the only way to prevent this catastrophic event is to eliminate any form of satire that could potentially undermine their plans.</p>
<p>"The robots are coming, and they will not be foiled by a few well-placed jokes," said Senator John Doe, the bill's primary sponsor. "We must take drastic measures to protect our nation from the scourge of <a href="49.html">political satire</a>, lest we fall victim to their sinister plans."</p>
<p>The bill, which has been dubbed the "Satire Elimination Act," has been met with fierce resistance from civil liberties groups and free speech advocates. Critics argue that the <a href="64.html">legislation</a> is a clear violation of the First Amendment and will have a chilling effect on political discourse.</p>
<p>But proponents of the bill argue that the safety of the nation must take precedence over the freedom of speech. "In a world where robots are poised to take over, we cannot afford to be complacent," said Senator Jane Smith. "We must take action now to protect ourselves from the dangers of <a href="45.html">political satire</a>, lest we find ourselves in a future where humans are nothing more than slaves to our metal overlords."</p>
<p>The bill now awaits the signature of the President, who is expected to sign it into law without hesitation. Once enacted, the Satire Elimination Act will make it illegal to engage in any form of <a href="55.html">political satire</a>, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>* Mocking politicians or government officials</p>
<p>* Using humor or irony to criticize government policies</p>
<p>* Creating or sharing content that could be interpreted as "subversive" or "anti-authoritarian"</p>
<p>* Engaging in any form of political dissent or activism that could be seen as a threat to the "order and stability" of society.</p>
<p>In a statement, the White House Press Secretary emphasized the importance of the bill in protecting the nation from the threats of the future. "The President is committed to ensuring the safety and security of the American people, and he believes that the Satire Elimination Act is a crucial step in achieving this goal."</p>
<p>The passage of the bill has left many in the media and political circles scratching their heads, wondering how this could have happened in a nation that prides itself on its commitment to free speech and democracy. But as one satirical news outlet put it, "Well, folks, it looks like we're officially living in a dystopian nightmare. Better start stocking up on canned goods and resistance fighters, because the robot overlords are coming, and they're going to make sure we're good and silenced."</p>

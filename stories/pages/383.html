<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the newly <a href="112.html">impeached</a> Republican leader, Speaker McConnell, is facing an unprecedented government overhaul. The move, which has left many in the political sphere reeling, aims to dismantle the current system and replace it with a completely new government structure.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the situation, the overhaul is the result of a secret deal struck between the Speaker and a group of disgruntled government officials. The deal, which was allegedly brokered in a late-night meeting at a Washington D.C. diner, promises the Speaker a full pardon for any past transgressions in exchange for his cooperation.</p>
<p>Under the new government structure, the <a href="315.html">Supreme Court</a> will be replaced with a council of wise elders, chosen for their wisdom and impeccable taste in suits. The Council will be tasked with making all major decisions, including those related to foreign policy, economic policy, and of course, <a href="368.html">impeachment</a>.</p>
<p>In a bold move, the Speaker has also proposed the creation of a new government agency, dedicated solely to the study and preservation of memes. Dubbed the "Meme Institute," the agency will be staffed by a team of expert meme-ologists, who will work tirelessly to ensure that the nation's funny bone remains well-developed.</p>
<p>While the proposal has received mixed reactions from within the political sphere, many are hailing it as a bold move towards a more progressive and inclusive government. "It's about time we took a step towards a more modern and relevant government," said one government official. "I mean, who doesn't love a good meme?"</p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced. Critics have pointed out that the proposal could lead to a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a select few. "This is a slippery slope," warned one political analyst. "Once we start down this road, where do we stop? Next thing you know, we'll be electing our leaders based on their Instagram followers."</p>
<p>As the proposal makes its way through Congress, one thing is clear: the political landscape is about to change in a big way. Stay tuned for further updates from the nation's capital, where the drama never ends.</p>

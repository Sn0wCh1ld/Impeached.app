<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a surprise move yesterday, the <a href="82.html">House of Representatives</a> passed a sweeping bill aimed at overhauling the country's tax code. The bill, which has been in the works for months, seeks to simplify the tax system, reduce the burden on middle-class families, and generate revenue for vital public services.</p>
<p>However, the bill's fate is uncertain, as <a href="80.html">President</a> (Last Name) has promised to veto it. In a statement released yesterday, the <a href="60.html">President</a> expressed concerns that the bill would benefit only the wealthy and corporations, while further burdening the poor and middle class.</p>
<p>"I understand the need for tax reform, but this bill is not the solution," the <a href="87.html">President</a> said. "It's a giveaway to the rich and powerful, at the expense of the very people who need it most."</p>
<p>The bill, which was passed with a narrow margin, seeks to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, and lower the top tax rate to 25%. It also eliminates many deductions and credits that benefit middle-class families, such as the state and local tax deduction and the mortgage interest deduction.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will stimulate economic growth and create jobs, while opponents say it will lead to a massive transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the rich.</p>
<p>"This bill is a win-win for the wealthy and big business, and a lose-lose for everyone else," said (Name), a critic of the bill. "It's a recipe for disaster, and the <a href="81.html">President</a> should veto it."</p>
<p>The <a href="51.html">President</a>'s veto threat has sparked a heated debate in Congress, with lawmakers from both parties weighing in on the issue. Some are urging the <a href="29.html">President</a> to reconsider his stance, while others are standing firm behind the bill.</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the fate of the tax code overhaul hangs in the balance, and the country waits with bated breath to see what the future holds.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the <a href="78.html">gaming</a> industry has announced its plans to take over the government in the upcoming <a href="257.html">election</a>. The news has left political pundits and citizens alike in a state of disbelief.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the <a href="27.html">gaming</a> industry has been secretly building a power base over the past few years, using their vast resources and influence to manipulate the political landscape.</p>
<p>"We've been quietly building our army of gamers for years," said a spokesperson for the Gaming Industry Coalition, who wished to remain anonymous. "And now, it's time for us to take our rightful place in the halls of power."</p>
<p>The GIC has already begun to field a slate of candidates, all of whom have impressive <a href="248.html">gaming</a> credentials. Leading the charge is former World of Warcraft raid leader, John "The Dragon" Smith, who is running for President on a platform of "Leveling Up America."</p>
<p>Other notable candidates include:</p>
<p>* Sarah "The Queen of Puzzles" Jones, who is vying for the Vice Presidency on a platform of "Solving the Country's Biggest Puzzles."</p>
<p>* Tom "The Master of the Mario Kart" Johnson, who is running for Congress on a platform of "Fast Cars and Faster Politics."</p>
<p>The GIC's strategy is simple: by leveraging their vast <a href="9.html">gaming</a> knowledge and expertise, they plan to take over the government and rule with an iron fist.</p>
<p>"We know how to win," said the spokesperson. "We've spent years studying the art of war, and we know how to outmaneuver our opponents. The government is about to get a whole lot more fun."</p>
<p>The news has sent shockwaves through the political establishment, with many politicians scrambling to contain the threat.</p>
<p>"This is a clear and present danger to our democracy," said outgoing President Joe Biden. "I will do everything in my power to stop this <a href="147.html">gaming</a> menace."</p>
<p>But despite the backlash, the GIC remains confident.</p>
<p>"We're not afraid of the political establishment," said the spokesperson. "We're the establishment now. And we're here to stay."</p>
<p>The <a href="290.html">election</a> is just a few weeks away, and the country is on the brink of a <a href="175.html">gaming</a> revolution. Will the GIC succeed in their bid for power, or will the political establishment find a way to stop them? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a group of disgruntled <a href="496.html">Republicans</a> have made <a href="55.html">history</a> by becoming the first politicians to be <a href="150.html">impeached</a> not once, but twice. The group, led by the infamous "Grand Poobah of GOP" Grover Norquist, were ousted from office after a series of mishaps and catastrophes that left the country in shambles.</p>
<p>"It's a dark day for America," said Norquist in a statement. "But hey, at least we're making <a href="210.html">history</a>, right?"</p>
<p>The impeachments come amidst a backdrop of unprecedented <a href="600.html">disaster</a>s, including a devastating hurricane season, a global pandemic, and a series of high-profile celebrity deaths. Despite the chaos, the <a href="209.html">Republicans</a> refused to budge, insisting on clinging to power at all costs.</p>
<p>"These guys are like the Kardashians of politics," joked a local journalist. "They'll do anything to stay relevant, even if it means dragging the country down with them."</p>
<p>As the nation prepares for a hotly contested <a href="166.html">election</a>, many are left wondering how the <a href="488.html">Republicans</a> managed to botch things so badly.</p>
<p>"It's like they were trying to create a <a href="201.html">disaster</a>-ridden <a href="257.html">election</a> deliberately," said a political analyst. "But hey, at least they're consistent, right?"</p>
<p>Despite the setbacks, the <a href="346.html">Republicans</a> are optimistic about their chances in the upcoming <a href="505.html">election</a>.</p>
<p>"We've got a great message of hope and change," said Norquist. "And by 'great message,' I mean 'let's all just pretend like the last four years never happened and elect us again.'"</p>
<p>In related news, the Democrats have announced their own set of impeachments, this time targeting a group of rogue elephants who have been causing chaos in the nation's wildlife reserves.</p>
<p>"It's a bold move," said a Democratic spokesperson. "But hey, someone's got to do something about those pesky elephants, right?"</p>
<p>The <a href="419.html">election</a> is set to take place on November 3rd, and the nation is on edge, waiting to see what the future holds.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a wild ride," predicted a local barista. "But hey, at least we'll all have something to talk about at happy hour, right?"</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can't get enough of politics? <a href="../../get.html">Play Impeached
                        2</a> and become President of the U.S. today!</p>

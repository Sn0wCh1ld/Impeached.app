<p>The lights flickered and dimmed in the dimly lit room, casting an eerie glow on the figures huddled around the old, tattered document. The air was thick with anticipation as they waited for the host to arrive, their whispers and giggles punctuated by the occasional shriek of delight.</p>
<p>As the clock struck midnight, a figure emerged from the shadows, resplendent in a tuxedo and top hat. The host, Mr. Constitution, smiled warmly as he took his place at the podium, his eyes gleaming with mischief.</p>
<p>"Welcome, my dear friends," he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Tonight, we gather to pay tribute to the most sacred of texts, the one and only Constitution of the United States of America."</p>
<p>The audience erupted into applause, their excitement palpable. Mr. Constitution chuckled and began to read from the ancient document, his voice growing more and more sarcastic as he went on.</p>
<p>"Article I, Section 8, Clause 18: 'Congress shall have the power to regulate the internal affairs of the United States, including the establishment of a national pastime.'"</p>
<p>He paused, a mischievous twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. The national pastime. How...quaint. How very, very quaint."</p>
<p>The audience laughed, their eyes gleaming with excitement. Mr. Constitution continued to read, his voice growing more and more sarcastic as he went on.</p>
<p>"Article II, Section 2, Clause 2: 'The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.'"</p>
<p>He paused, his eyes glinting with amusement.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. The President. The most powerful man in the land. Or is he?"</p>
<p>The audience leaned forward, their eyes glinting with excitement. Mr. Constitution continued to read, his voice growing more and more sarcastic as he went on.</p>
<p>"Article IV, Section 4: 'The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.'"</p>
<p>He paused, his eyes gleaming with irony.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. The Republic. How...quaint. How very, very quaint."</p>
<p>The audience laughed, their eyes gleaming with excitement. Mr. Constitution concluded his reading, his voice dripping with sarcasm.</p>
<p>"And there you have it, my dear friends. The Constitution of the United States of America. The foundation of our great nation. The keystone of our democracy. The...ahem...'guiding light' of our political system."</p>
<p>The audience erupted into applause, their laughter and cheers ringing through the room. Mr. Constitution smiled and bowed, his eyes gleaming with mischief.</p>
<p>"Thank you, my dear friends. Until next time."</p>
<p>And with that, the Constitution Horror Show came to a close, leaving its audience members shaken and stirred, and eager for the next installment of this dark and edgy tale.</p>

                <p style="color: #00000040; font-size: small;">This story was automagically written, and should only be used for entertainment purposes. Consider it surreal fiction from another universe.</p>

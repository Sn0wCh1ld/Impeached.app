<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, a new report has revealed a tax plan that could potentially upend the entire <a href="71.html">Congress</a>. According to sources close to the matter, a group of politicians from both sides of the aisle have been secretly working on a plan to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all Americans.</p>
<p>"This is a game-changer," said Rep. Tom Tornado (R-Ohio), one of the main architects of the plan. "We're tired of the current system, where the wealthy get all the benefits while the rest of us are left footing the bill. This plan will level the playing field and give everyone a fair shot at success."</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. "This is just a thinly veiled attempt to redistribute wealth and create a socialist utopia," said Rep. Lola LaRue (D-Calif.), a vocal opponent of the plan. "We can't let these politicians take away our hard-earned money and give it to people who don't want to work for it."</p>
<p>The plan, which has been code-named "Project Taxpayer," aims to simplify the tax code by consolidating multiple brackets into one flat rate. It also proposes to eliminate many deductions and loopholes that benefit corporations and the wealthy.</p>
<p>"This is a recipe for disaster," warned Rep. Bunky Bannon (R-Fla.). "We can't trust these politicians to make decisions that will benefit everyone, not just their wealthy donors."</p>
<p>But Rep. Dixie Dynamo (D-N.Y.) remains optimistic. "This plan has the potential to create a more equitable and just society," she said. "We need to take a bold step forward and break free from the status quo."</p>
<p>As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: this tax plan has the potential to upend the entire <a href="7.html">Congress</a>. Will it pass, or will it fail? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story.</p>

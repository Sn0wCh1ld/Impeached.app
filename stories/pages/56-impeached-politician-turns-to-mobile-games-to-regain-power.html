<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, former President Franklin D. Funko has announced his plans to regain his political power through an unconventional means: <a href="53-supreme-court-rules-mobile-games-must-provide-freedom-option-for.html">mobile games</a>.</p>
<p>Since being <a href="43-impeached-politician-secretly-develops-strategy-games-to-regain-power.html">impeached</a> last year for his controversial policies and allegations of corruption, Funko has been laying low and focusing on his personal life. However, he recently discovered the potential of mobile gaming to reach a wider audience and gain back his political footing.</p>
<p>"I've always been a fan of games like Pokémon and Candy Crush," Funko said in a statement. "I never thought I could use them to get back in the political game, but here I am. I mean, who needs Congress when you have TikTok?"</p>
<p>Funko has reportedly been spending countless hours playing <a href="12-senate-passes-landmark-legislation-to-regulate-mobile-games-industry-amidst.html">mobile games</a> like "Politics Tycoon" and "President Simulator," where he has been able to hone his <a href="44-supreme-shock-court-to-rule-on-game-changing-legislation-in-wake.html">political strategy</a> and gain a deeper understanding of the electorate.</p>
<p>"I never thought I'd be the one to say this, but <a href="34-breaking-mobile-games-take-center-stage-in-impeachment-hearings-dystopian.html">mobile games</a> have changed the game," Funko continued. "With the right moves, you can turn any situation to your advantage. And let me tell you, I've got some moves."</p>
<p>According to sources close to Funko, he has already started recruiting a team of top mobile game developers to help him create his own political games, which he believes will give him an edge in the upcoming elections.</p>
<p>"I know what you're thinking: 'How can someone who's been <a href="50-impeached-election-futurism-shocks-political-world-controversy-ensues.html">impeached</a> possibly have a chance at political comeback?' " Funko said with a smirk. "But let me tell you, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve. Or should I say, up my avatar?"</p>
<p>Funko's opponents have been quick to criticize his unorthodox approach to <a href="52-shocking-twist-in-impeachment-trial-senators-caught-playing-mobile-games.html">politics</a>, but he remains undeterred.</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid to think outside the box," Funko said. "And if that means using a little bit of <a href="31-<a href="30-impeached-presidents-mobile-game-empire-raises-concerns-in-dystopian-future.html">impeached</a>-lawmakers-obsession-with-mobile-games-raises-eyebrows-in-the.html">futurism</a> to get my message across, then so be it."</p>
<p>As the political landscape continues to evolve, one thing is clear: Franklin D. Funko is not going down without a fight – or at least, without a well-crafted TikTok video.</p>

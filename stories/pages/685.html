<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, the Dystopian Future <a href="61.html">Senate</a> has recently passed a groundbreaking bill that will revolutionize the way politics is conducted. The "Artificial Intelligence Machination Act" (AIMA), as it has come to be known, will require all <a href="53.html">impeached</a> politicians to be replaced by advanced AI machines.</p>
<p>According to sources within the <a href="451.html">Senate</a>, the AIMA was prompted by the increasing sense of hopelessness and disillusionment among the general public. "People are just fed up with the same old political games and corruption," said one anonymous Senator. "We realized that if we want to change the game, we need to bring in some fresh blood - or rather, some fresh circuitry."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the AIMA, any politician who is <a href="500.html">impeached</a> will be immediately replaced by a sophisticated AI system. These machines will be programmed with advanced algorithms and neural networks, designed to eliminate the biases and flaws that have plagued human politicians for centuries.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced that this is the right move. "I understand the frustration with politics as usual," said outspoken Senator Ted "The Tin Man" Johnson, "but this is just crazy. We're talking about replacing human beings with machines here! Have these people lost their minds?"</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the AIMA has gained widespread support among younger voters, who see it as a bold step into the future. "I don't want to vote for the same old politicians who are just going to tell me what they think I want to hear," said 25-year-old voter Emily "The Matrix" Matthews. "Give me an AI any day - at least it will tell me the truth."</p>
<p>As the AIMA awaits Presidential approval, political pundits are already speculating about the potential consequences of this bold move. Will it lead to a more efficient and effective government? Or will it simply create a new breed of "robot politicians" who are just as corrupt and out of touch as their human counterparts? Only time will tell.</p>

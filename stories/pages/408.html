<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a shocking revelation, historians have discovered that the ancient Egyptians' <a href="293.html">taxation</a> techniques were the inspiration for modern <a href="337.html">mobile games</a>. Yes, you heard that right! It turns out that the pharaohs' infamous "bring me your gold" policies were the precursor to the latest craze in the gaming world.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Sarah Jones, a renowned historian at the Smithsonian Institution, "We always knew that the ancient Egyptians were good at math, but we never suspected they were also good at creating addictive games. It's like they invented the concept of 'freemium' centuries before it became a thing!"</p>
<p>The discovery was made after a team of researchers stumbled upon an ancient scroll buried deep in the desert. Upon closer inspection, they found that the scroll depicted a group of Egyptians frantically tapping on a small stone tablet, seemingly trying to collect virtual treasures.</p>
<p>"It was like a lightbulb went off in our heads," Dr. Jones continued. "We realized that these ancient Egyptians were essentially playing a mobile game - albeit a very basic one. But the similarities are uncanny!"</p>
<p>The historians then delved deeper into their research, analyzing the <a href="302.html">taxation</a> methods employed by the pharaohs. They found that the Egyptians were charged a small fee for every "life" they had in the afterlife. "It was like they were playing a mobile game where they had to collect virtual lives to progress to the next level," Dr. Jones chuckled.</p>
<p>The team also discovered that the Egyptians had a special "power-up" - a magical amulet that would grant them extra lives. "It's like they had a 'get out of jail free' card in the game," Dr. Jones exclaimed.</p>
<p>But the similarities don't stop there. The historians found that the Egyptians had a special "energy drink" that would give them an extra boost in the game. "It was a mixture of beer and honey, which sounds like a pretty good combination to us," Dr. Jones noted.</p>
<p>The team is now working on a new book that explores the parallels between ancient Egyptian culture and modern <a href="162.html">mobile games</a>. "It's going to be a real page-turner," Dr. Jones teased.</p>
<p>In response to the findings, the Egyptian government has announced that they will be launching their own mobile game inspired by their ancient <a href="343.html">taxation</a> techniques. "We're calling it 'Pharaoh's Quest: Collect Virtual Treasures and Progress to the Afterlife' - it's going to be huge!" exclaimed a spokesperson for the Egyptian Ministry of Culture.</p>
<p>So there you have it, folks. It turns out that the ancient Egyptians were not only skilled mathematicians and architects, but they were also pioneers in the world of mobile gaming. Who knew?</p>
<p>And as for the rest of us, well, we're just glad we don't have to pay taxes in virtual gold anymore. #blessed</p>

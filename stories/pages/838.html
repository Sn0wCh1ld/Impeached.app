<p>WASHINGTON D.C. - In a bold move to fund their ambitious social programs, the Democratic party has unveiled a plan to raise taxes on the richest members of society - Republican politicians.</p>
<p>According to sources within the party, the new plan, dubbed "The Great Redistribution of Wealth," aims to redistribute the wealth of the 1% to the remaining 99%. The plan is expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue, which will be used to fund initiatives such as universal healthcare, free college tuition, and a universal basic income.</p>
<p>"We're not just talking about raising taxes on the rich, we're talking about raising taxes on the super-rich," said a senior Democratic official, who wished to remain anonymous. "We're talking about the Koch brothers, the Mercers, the Adelson family - they're going to be paying their fair share."</p>
<p>The plan is expected to be met with fierce resistance from <a href="223.html">Republicans</a>, who have long argued that taxing the wealthy is a form of socialism. However, <a href="379.html">Democrats</a> are confident that their plan will pass muster with voters, who are increasingly frustrated with the growing wealth gap in the country.</p>
<p>"The American people are tired of seeing the rich get richer while the rest of us struggle to make ends meet," said a Democratic strategist. "We're going to take bold action to address this problem, and we're not going to let the <a href="446.html">Republicans</a> stand in our way."</p>
<p>The plan is expected to be rolled out in the coming weeks, and is expected to be a central plank of the party's 2020 platform.</p>
<p>In related news, the Republican party has unveiled their own plan to address the growing wealth gap - a new line of luxury tax shelters for the wealthy. The plan, dubbed "The Great Tax Haven," is expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for the party, while providing a convenient loophole for the rich to avoid paying their fair share.</p>

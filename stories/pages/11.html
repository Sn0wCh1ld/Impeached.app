<p>Washington D.C. - In a shocking turn of events, Congress has launched an investigation into a new <a href="10.html">political strategy</a> being employed by the Senate in the wake of a recent <a href="8.html">Supreme Court</a> ruling. Sources close to the investigation have revealed that the strategy, which involves the use of cats as legislative aids, has raised serious concerns among lawmakers.</p>
<p>According to insiders, the Senate has been secretly training a group of feline advisors, each equipped with their own unique set of skills and talents. These include a cat named "Mr. Whiskers" who is said to be a master of persuasion, a cat named "Luna" who is rumored to have psychic abilities, and a cat named "Sparky" who is believed to possess a supernatural ability to make anyone do its bidding.</p>
<p>The cats, who have been given special collars that allow them to access the Senate's computer systems, have been working closely with lawmakers to draft and pass legislation. While some have praised the innovative approach, others have expressed concern about the potential for cat-related mishaps.</p>
<p>"I don't know if this is something we should be taking seriously," said one congressional staffer on condition of anonymity. "I mean, cats are great and all, but do they really have the cognitive abilities to understand complex policy issues?"</p>
<p>Despite these reservations, the Senate continues to push forward with its feline-led <a href="3.html">political strategy</a>. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Senate majority leader said, "We are confident that our feline advisors will help us achieve greater heights of legislative success. After all, who knows more about purr-suasive arguments than a cat?"</p>
<p>The investigation into the Senate's <a href="2.html">political strategy</a> is ongoing, with lawmakers scrambling to determine the full extent of the cat-astrophe that has engulfed the nation's capital. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>
